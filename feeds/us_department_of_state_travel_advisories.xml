                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Reissued with updates to COVID-19 information.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC), including the Special Administrative Regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau due to<b> arbitrary enforcement of local laws.</b>&nbsp;See specific risks and conditions in each jurisdiction below.&nbsp; Commercial transportation options for international departure and arrival are available. Exercise increased caution in the PRC due to <b>wrongful detentions</b>.<b></b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>The PRC government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including issuing exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without fair and transparent process under the law.</p> <p>The Department has determined the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the PRC government exists in mainland China.</p> <p>U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR and the Macau SAR, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens in the PRC may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law.</p> <p>Foreigners in the PRC and the Hong Kong SAR, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign government personnel, and journalists have been unjustly interrogated and detained by PRC officials for alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has also interrogated, detained, and expelled U.S. citizens living and working in the PRC.</p> <p>Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC, Hong Kong SAR, or Macau SAR governments.</p> <p>In addition, the PRC government has used restrictions on travel or departure from the PRC, or so-called exit bans, to:</p> <ul> <li>compel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations,</li> <li>pressure family members of the restricted individual to return to the PRC from abroad,</li> <li>resolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens, and</li> <li>gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.</li> </ul> <p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it in a court of law.&nbsp; Relatives, including minor children, of those under investigation in the PRC may become subject to an exit ban.</p> <p>The PRC, Hong Kong SAR, and Macau SAR governments do not recognize dual nationality.&nbsp; U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the PRC, Hong Kong SAR, and Macau SAR governments may prevent the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General from providing consular services.</p> <p>Check with the PRC Embassy in the United States for the most updated information on travel to the PRC. In some limited circumstances travelers to mainland China may face additional testing requirements to enter some facilities or events.</p> <p>The Department of State does not provide or coordinate direct medical care to private U.S. citizens abroad. U.S. citizens overseas may receive PRC-approved COVID vaccine doses where they are eligible.</p> <p>The PRC government has not authorized for general use in mainland China many COVID vaccines commonly available in the United States and Europe, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson products. It has conditionally authorized thirteen PRC-made vaccines; these are available to anyone residing in China. The FDA has not approved the two most commonly available, Sinopharm and Sinovac. Sinopharm and Sinovac have received approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p> <p>In Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR, BioNTech mRNA COVID vaccines including the bivalent option are available. Please contact local health authorities for information on available vaccines.</p> <p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">FDA&#8217;s website</a>&nbsp;to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States.</p> <p><b>XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION and TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION</b></p> <p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uyghur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.</p> <p><b>HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION</b></p> <p>Since the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, the PRC unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power in the Hong Kong SAR. The PRC has demonstrated an intent to use this authority to target a broad range of activities it defines as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. PRC security forces, including the new Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in the Hong Kong SAR and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong judiciary.</p> <p><b>Demonstrations</b>: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.</p> <p><b>Propaganda</b>: A PRC propaganda campaign has falsely accused individuals, including U.S. citizens, of fomenting unrest in the Hong Kong SAR. In some cases, the campaign has published their personal information, resulting in threats of violence on social media.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for the PRC, the<u>&nbsp;</u><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/HongKong.html">information page&nbsp;</a>for the Hong Kong SAR, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Macau.html">information page</a>&nbsp;for the Macau SAR for additional information on travel.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR and the Macau SAR:</p> <ul> <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, read the&nbsp;<a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/?_ga=2.120372872.167054240.1647399637-1564366313.1646718901">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for the PRC and the&nbsp;<a href="https://hk.usconsulate.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">Consulate General COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for the Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR for specific COVID-19 information.</li> <li>For the Hong Kong SAR, monitor local media, local transportations sites, and apps like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mtr.com.hk/mtrmobile/en/">MTR Mobile</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bravobus.com.hk/home/default.aspx?intLangID=1">CitybusNWFB</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>&nbsp;for updates.</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations.</li> <li>Exercise caution in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.</li> <li>Avoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Keep a low profile.</li> <li>For the Hong Kong SAR, review your Hong Kong flight status with your airline or at the Hong Kong International Airport&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page">website</a><u>.</u></li> <li>Enter the PRC on your U.S. passport with a valid PRC visa and keep it with you.</li> <li>If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately.</li> <li>If you plan to enter the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/KoreaDemocraticPeoplesRepublicof.html">DPRK Travel Advisory</a>.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Syria due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;risk of unjust detention.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria.</p> <p>Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings by armed groups, unjust arrests and/or detentions, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment of civilian centers pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p> <p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, unjust arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p> <p>Protests and demonstrations are quelled by government forces through aggressive tactics and protestors, activists, and political dissenters are routinely detained without access to legal representation or communications with friends and family.</p> <p>Terrorist groups are active in Syria. Parts of Syria have experienced recent increases in incidents of bombings, IEDs, and assassinations. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p> <p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target. U.S. citizens are also targets of abduction and/or unjust detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where widespread cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Minors, persons with physical, sensory, or mental disabilities, and elderly have frequently been victims of unjust detention. The Syrian government has also been implicated in the enforced or involuntary disappearance of more than 100,000 citizens, including medical and humanitarian workers, journalists, human rights activists, political opposition, and additionally those suspected of affiliation with these groups and their family members. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/10/2018-26680/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)</a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SyrianArabRepublic.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Syria.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Syria:</p> <ul> <li>Read&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, and read the&nbsp;<a href="https://sy.usembassy.gov/" adhocenable="false">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for country-specific COVID-19 information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Visit our website on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review with updates to wrongful detention and health information.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>civil unrest and armed conflict</b>.&nbsp; Reconsider travel to Burma due to&nbsp;<b>limited and/or inadequate healthcare resources</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercise increased caution due to&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>areas with land mines and unexploded ordnance</b>.</p> <p><b>COUNTRY SUMMARY</b>:&nbsp;The Burmese military detained and deposed elected government officials in a February 2021 coup d'&#233;tat. &nbsp;Protests and demonstrations against military rule occur.&nbsp; The military often responds to these protests by arbitrarily arresting individuals and with the indiscriminate use of deadly force against protesters and bystanders.</p> <p>The Department of State has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the military regime exists.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services in Burma as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Rangoon. &nbsp;Dependents under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burma.</p> <p><b>Civil unrest</b> <b>and armed conflict</b> occur throughout Burma.&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of&nbsp;<b>civil unrest and armed conflict</b>&nbsp;varies significantly between and within states and regions and may change at any time.</p> <p>Civil unrest and armed violence due to fighting between the Burmese military and various ethnic groups and militia occur in parts of Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and Shan states, as well as in Sagaing, Mandalay, and Magway regions.</p> <p>In Northern Shan state and parts of Chin, Kachin, and Rakhine states there are&nbsp;<b>land mines and unexploded ordnance</b>; their locations are often not marked or identifiable, and foreign travelers have been injured in the past.</p> <p>The military regime arbitrarily enforces local laws, including carrying out <b>random and wrongful detentions without due process</b>.&nbsp;

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Saudi Arabia due to&nbsp;<b>the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian facilities.</b>&nbsp;Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to&nbsp;<b>terrorism.</b>&nbsp;Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p>Do not travel to the following locations due to&nbsp;<b>missile and drone attacks</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>:</p> <ul> <li>Within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, as well as the cities of Abha, Jizan, Najran, and Khamis Mushayt;</li> <li>Abha airport;</li> <li>Qatif in the Eastern Province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.</li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: U.S. government personnel must adhere to the above travel restrictions. As such, the U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these locations.</p> <p>Missile and drone attacks perpetrated by Iran and Iran-supported militant groups represent a significant threat. The Islamic Republic of Iran has supplied Yemen-based Houthis and other regional proxy groups with weapons to conduct destructive and sometimes lethal attacks using drones, missiles, and rockets against a variety of Saudi sites, including critical infrastructure, civilian airports, military bases, and energy facilities throughout the country, as well as vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Recent attacks were aimed at targets throughout Saudi Arabia including Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, Jizan, Khamis Mushayt, the civilian airport in Abha, Al Kharj, military installations in the south, as well as oil and gas facilities.</p> <p>Debris from intercepted drones and missiles represents a significant risk to civilian areas and populations. Militant groups continue to plan and conduct attacks against locations in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens living and working near military bases and critical civilian infrastructure, particularly near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile, drone, and rocket attacks.</p> <p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks against Saudi and Western targets throughout Saudi Arabia. Terrorists attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, large gatherings, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists are also known to time attacks around major holidays and/or in response to military operations. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners. ISIS claimed responsibility for a November 2020 IED attack at a cemetery in Jeddah during a ceremony commemorating the end of World War I. Several Western diplomats were in attendance.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Saudi Arabia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM).

In Nassau, practice&nbsp;increased vigilance in the &#8220;Over the Hill&#8221; area (south of Shirley Street)&nbsp;where gang-on-gang&nbsp;violence has resulted&nbsp;in a high homicide rate primarily affecting the local population. Violent crime,&nbsp;such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults,&nbsp;occur in both tourist&nbsp;and non-tourist&nbsp;areas. Be vigilant when staying at short-term vacation rental properties&nbsp;where private security companies do&nbsp;not have a presence.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Sudan due to <b>civil unrest.</b> Reconsider travel due<b> </b>to<b> crime, terrorism, kidnapping, </b>and <b>armed conflict</b>.</p> <p>Sudan is experiencing sporadic civil unrest and protests across the country. Communication disruptions, including internet and cell phone service, can occur during protests.</p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking can occur. This type of crime is more frequent outside of Khartoum.</p> <p>Members of known terrorist groups and individuals sympathetic to these groups in Sudan could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities, and areas frequented by Westerners.</p> <p>Demonstrations can occur with no warning. The majority of recent demonstrations in Khartoum have been planned and peaceful. However, police and other security forces may intervene to disperse demonstrators, including with the use of tear gas when protests occur near key government locations and/or impair freedom of movement.</p> <p>Violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas that border South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area).

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued after periodic review without changes.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Guatemala due to<b>&nbsp;crime</b>. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p>Do not travel to:</p> <ul> <li>San Marcos Department (except the city of San Marcos) due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li> <li>Huehuetenango Department (except the city of Huehuetenango) due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li> <li>Zone 18 and the city of Villa Nueva in Guatemala City due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>.</li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Violent crime such as extortion, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, narcotics trafficking and gang activity are common in Guatemala. Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to criminal incidents resulting in a low arrest and conviction rate. Guatemala&#8217;s National Tourist Assistance Program (<a href="https://guiagt.com/item/proatur-programa-de-asistencia-al-turista/" adhocenable="false">PROATUR</a>) provides 24-hour emergency assistance and routine guidance to tourists. PROATUR also provide additional security in locations frequented by tourists. The call center is staffed with Spanish and English speakers and can be reached 24/7 by calling 1500 or +502-2290-2800.</p> <p>U.S. government personnel and family members are prohibited from traveling to/throughout the above-mentioned areas for personal travel but are permitted to travel throughout the rest of Guatemala, including tourist destinations such as Tikal, Antigua, Lake Atitl&#225;n, and Pacific coast areas in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla Departments.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Guatemala.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Guatemala.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Guatemala:</p> <ul> <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, and read the&nbsp;<a href="https://gt.usembassy.gov/alert-covid-19-2/">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for country-specific COVID-19 information.</li> <li>When traveling to Lake Atitl&#225;n, use certified tourist providers and travel between villages on the lakeshore by chartered boat, as perimeter paths pose a serious crime risk and are not easily accessible by emergency services. Hiking in the area, while popular, is best undertaken with the assistance of a local guide to ensure safety, as criminals are known to target some routes.</li> <li>When visiting Pacific coast beaches and resorts in the Santa Rosa and Escuintla Departments, arrange travel through hotel, resort, or charter agents. We recommend traveling to and from hotels, resorts, and fishing charters via road from Guatemala City during daylight hours only.</li> <li>Visitors are strongly advised to avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean, since currents and undertows are strong, and beaches lack adequate lifeguards or emergency response.</li> <li>Visitors should not leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and are advised to decline invitations from strangers to private parties or gatherings.</li> <li>Consider staying in hotels or other lodging facilities that offer secure parking, doormen, and a dedicated and professional security staff.</li> <li>Request security escorts, which are available for tourist groups, from the Guatemalan Tourism Institute (<a href="https://inguat.gob.gt/" adhocenable="false">INGUAT</a>).</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings and avoid walking or driving at night.</li> <li>Do take radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo), INGUAT-approved taxis from the &#8220;SAFE&#8221; stand at the airport, hotel taxis, vetted private drivers, and/or Uber.</li> <li>Do not take public transportation, including white car taxis. U.S. government personnel and their family members are prohibited from using these forms of transportation.</li> <li>Do not attempt to hike walking trails or volcanoes without the services of a qualified local guide.&nbsp; Robberies are commonplace, and emergency response is lacking.</li> <li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.</li> <li>Do not use public ATMs.</li> <li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry, and avoid using mobile devices in public.</li> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive Alerts while in Guatemala and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/" adhocenable="false">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov" adhocenable="false">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Guatemala.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

The following zones in Guatemala City are of elevated concern due to crime: 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 19, 21, and 24. U.S. citizens should take appropriate security measures when traveling to and from the airport such as only using vetted transportation services, not displaying valuables or other signs of wealth, refraining from using mobile devices in public, and not lingering outside the airport. U.S. citizens are advised not to hail white-car taxis on the street in Guatemala City. Use radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo), INGUAT-approved taxis from the &#8220;SAFE&#8221; stand at the airport, hotel taxis, vetted private drivers, or Uber.</p> <p>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</p> ]]>

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Reissued with updates to health information.</i></b></p> <p>Do Not Travel to Belarus due to the&nbsp;<b>arbitrary enforcement of laws</b>, <b>the risk of detention</b>,&nbsp;<b>the Russian military attack on neighboring Ukraine</b>, and <b>the buildup of Russian military in Belarus along the border with Ukraine</b>. U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately via commercial or private means.</p> <p>On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice. U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon and as safely as possible and to contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.</p> <p>U.S. citizens in Belarus who need assistance can also call the Department of State at 1(606) 260-4379 (from outside the United States) or e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:consularminsk@state.gov">consularminsk@state.gov</a>.&nbsp; For inquiries from within the United States, please call 1-833-741-2777.</p> <p>Due to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked attack on Ukraine from Belarus, U.S. citizens located in or considering travel to Belarus should be aware that the situation is unpredictable and there is heightened tension in the region. &nbsp; Potential harassment targeted specifically at foreigners is also possible.&nbsp; Given the heightened volatility of the situation, U.S. citizens are strongly advised against traveling to Belarus.</p> <p>The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens to exercise increased awareness and vigilance regarding political and military tensions in the region. &nbsp;U.S. citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations and to regularly reevaluate possible departure&nbsp;plans in the event of an emergency.</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with opposition parties and alleged participation in political demonstrations. U.S. citizens in the vicinity of the demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment and/or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media. On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a commercial aircraft transiting Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger.</p> <p>Belarus enforces special restrictions on dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals and may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals&#8217; U.S. citizenship, including denying or delaying U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals.</p> <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an Advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting all U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. airmen, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating at all altitudes in the Minsk Flight Information Region (FIR) (UMMV).

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information.</i></b></p> <p>Exercise increased caution in Bangladesh due to<b>&nbsp;crime, terrorism,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;kidnapping.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: In Bangladesh the crime rate impacting foreigners is generally low. However, travelers should be aware of petty crimes such as pickpocketing in crowded areas. Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh&#8217;s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality. These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.</p> <p>Terrorism events can happen with little or no warning, with terrorists targeting public areas such as tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship, school campuses, and government facilities.</p> <p>Because of security concerns U.S. government employees in Bangladesh are subject to movement and travel restrictions. The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.</p> <p>Reconsider travel to southeast Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Hill Tracts, due to<b>&nbsp;crime, terrorism, and kidnapping.</b></p> <p>Travel is dangerous to the Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to occasional communal violence and other security risks. Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued after periodic review with updates to the crime risk indicator.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to El Salvador due to&nbsp;<b>crime.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary: </b>In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador (GOES) declared a &#8220;State of Exception&#8221; in response to an increase in homicides. The declaration remains in effect. The State of Exception grants authorities power to arrest anyone suspected of gang activity and suspends several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial. Prison conditions are harsh. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception,&nbsp;some&nbsp;in a reportedly arbitrary manner. Under its Territorial Control Plan, the GOES also may, without prior warning, restrict access via checkpoints to areas suspected of gang activity. U.S. citizens are advised that access to and freedom of movement within these areas may be limited.</p> <p>Though there has been a significant reduction in gang-related activity, violent crime remains a concern throughout significant portions of the country. Crime rates vary among departamentos (states) and municipios (municipalities), and areas witnessing higher crime rates are often located in close proximity to lower crime areas or must be crossed in moving between lower risk areas. Local authorities may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents, although the concentration of resources in resort areas means these areas tend to be better policed than urban areas.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/ElSalvador.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to El Salvador.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to El Salvador:</p> <ul> <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, and read the&nbsp;<a href="https://sv.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for country-specific COVID-19 information.&nbsp;</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Do not walk outside after dark.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Reissued with updates to security information.</i></b></p> <p><b>Do not travel to</b> Somalia due to&nbsp;<b>crime</b>,&nbsp;<b>terrorism</b>,<b>&nbsp;civil unrest, health issues, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>piracy</b>.</p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>:&nbsp; Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia, including Puntland and the Somaliland region. &nbsp;Illegal roadblocks are widespread. Some schools and other facilities acting as &#8220;cultural rehabilitation&#8221; centers are operating throughout Somalia with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight.&nbsp; Reports of physical abuse and people being held against their will in these facilities are common.</p> <p>Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may conduct attacks with little or no warning, targeting airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other areas that attract large crowds and are frequented by Westerners, as well as government, military, and Western convoys.&nbsp; Methods of attack can include car bombs, suicide bombers, individual attackers, and mortar fire, among others. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, where there have been no major terrorist attacks since 2008, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning.&nbsp; The U.S. Embassy heavily restricts the movement of its employees in Mogadishu based on the critical threat environment.</p> <p>Civil unrest occurs throughout Somalia and can sometimes be violent.</p> <p>Medical facilities across Somalia have limited capacity and are often nonexistent in rural areas.</p> <p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia.</p> <p>The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation.&nbsp; For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/#ExternalPopup">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Somalia.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Somalia.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Somalia:</p> <ul> <li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia and review the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/somalia-travel-advisory.html/#ExternalPopup">Live Piracy Report</a>&nbsp;published by the International Maritime Bureau.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. &nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Somalia.html#ExternalPopup">Find a suggested list of such documents here</a>.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business) or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business), so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. &nbsp;This plan should specify whom you would contact first, and how that person should share the information.</li> <li>Identify key sources of possible assistance for you and your family in case of emergency, such as the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, FBI, the State Department, your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends/family in the high-risk area.</li> <li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are taken hostage or detained.</li> <li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).</li> <li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.</li> <li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.</li> <li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.</li> <li>Enroll your trip in the State Department's&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/" adhocenable="false">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov" adhocenable="false">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Country/Somalia/Detail">Country Security Report</a>&nbsp;for Somalia.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.&nbsp;

Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p> <p>Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.</p> <p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

There are reports of cash shortages within Russia.</p> <p>Commercial flight options are extremely limited and are often unavailable on short notice.&nbsp;If you wish to depart Russia, you should make independent arrangements as soon as possible. The U.S. Embassy has severe limitations on its ability to assist U.S. citizens to depart the country and transportation options may suddenly become even more limited. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/informationforuscitizeninrussia.html">here</a>&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.</p> <p>U.S. Embassy personnel are generally not permitted to travel on Russian air carriers due to safety concerns.&nbsp; The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) downgraded the air safety rating for Russia from Category 1 to Category 2 on April 21, 2022, due to Russia&#8217;s Federal Agency for Air Transport noncompliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards.&nbsp; The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over those areas of the Moscow Flight Information Region (FIR), the Samara FIR (UWWW) and the Rostov-na-Donu (URRV) FIR within 160NM of the boundaries of the Dnipro (UKDV) Flight Information Regions. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq" adhocenable="false">&nbsp;Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p> <p>The right of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are not consistently protected in Russia.&nbsp; U.S. citizens should avoid all political or social protests and not photograph security personnel at these events.&nbsp; Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have participated in demonstrations.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Country Summary:</b></p> <p>U.S. citizens, including former and current U.S. government and military personnel and private citizens engaged in business who are visiting or residing in Russia, have been interrogated without cause and threatened by Russian officials, and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.&nbsp;</p> <p>Russian security services may fail to notify the U.S. Embassy of the detention of a U.S. citizen and unreasonably delay U.S. consular assistance.&nbsp; Russian security services are increasing the arbitrary enforcement of local laws to target foreign and international organizations they consider &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;</p> <p>Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, singled out U.S. citizens in Russia for detention and harassment, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and convicted them in secret trials or without presenting credible evidence. Furthermore, Russian authorities arbitrarily enforce local laws against U.S. citizen religious workers and have opened questionable criminal investigations against U.S. citizens engaged in religious activity.&nbsp; U.S. citizens should avoid travel to Russia to perform work for or volunteer with non-governmental organizations or religious organizations.</p> <p>There have been multiple security incidents in southwestern Russia related to Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; The Russian government declared martial law in Russia&#8217;s regions bordering Ukraine (Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, Krasnodar) on October 20, 2022.&nbsp; The martial law regime allows the rapid introduction of restrictive measures such as curfew, seizure of private property, restriction of entry/exit and freedom of movement, internment of foreigners, forced relocation of local residents, and restrictions on public gatherings.&nbsp; U.S. citizens should avoid all travel to these areas.</p> <p>Recent legislation has expanded the ability of Russian authorities to detain, question, and arrest individuals suspected of acting against Russia&#8217;s interests, including engaging with foreign and international entities, discrediting the Russian state or military, as well as advocating for the rights of LGBTQI+ persons.</p> <p>Terrorist groups, both transnational and local terrorist organizations, and individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs and systems, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.&nbsp; Travel to the North Caucasus (including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus) is prohibited for U.S. government employees and strongly discouraged for U.S. citizens.</p> <p>The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts &#8211; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya &#8211; that Russia has purported to annex more recently.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Updated risk indicator and piracy information.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Papua New Guinea due to&#8239;<b>crime, civil unrest,</b> and <b>piracy</b>. Exercise increased caution due to&#8239;<b>kidnapping, unexploded ordnance, inconsistent availability of healthcare services, and potential for natural disasters.</b> Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. <b>Do not travel to:</b></p> <ul> <li>Southern Bougainville, particularly areas near the Panguna mine, due to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</li> <li>The Highlands region, other than the towns of Mt. Hagen and Goroka, due to&#8239;<b>civil unrest</b>.</li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary:</b> <b>Violent crime</b>, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, and armed robberies, is common. There have been reports of criminals attacking resorts popular with foreign tourists to steal goods and money. Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to <b>civil unrest</b> involving violence and to occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including the southern part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.</p> <p><b>Piracy</b> is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back.</p> <p>Visit our website on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/internl-maritime-piracy-robbery.html">International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea</a>.</p> <p><b>Kidnapping</b> for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign citizen was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign citizens employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &nbsp;</p> <p>Travelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of <b>unexploded ordnance (UXO)</b> remaining from World War II. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.</p> <p>Papua New Guinea has<b> inconsistent availability of healthcare services</b> which may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.</p> <p>Papua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes.

This has led to long lines at gas stations, but a fuel rationing system has helped to alleviate the situation. Public transportation has at times been limited or curtailed.&nbsp; Disrupted supply chains have caused food and medicine shortages, especially in remote areas, but most hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, and private hospitals have supplies. Limited duration power outages occur frequently, but most tourist facilities have backup generators.&nbsp; Protests over the economic situation could erupt at any time. In some instances, police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters. Travelers should monitor local media for updates on the ongoing situation. &nbsp;</p> <p>Terrorist attacks have occurred in Sri Lanka, with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote areas.&#8239;</p> <p>&#8239;Read the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SriLanka.html">country information page</a>.&#8239;</p> <p>&#8239;If you decide to travel to Sri Lanka:&#8239;</p> <ul> <li>Be aware of your surroundings when traveling to tourist locations and crowded public venues.&#8239;</li> <li>Follow the instructions of local authorities.&#8239;</li> <li>Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.&#8239;</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.&#8239;</li> <li>Enroll in the&#8239;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&#8239;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.&#8239;</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&#8239;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a>&#8239;and&#8239;<a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov">Twitter</a>.&#8239;</li> <li>Review the&#8239;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Country/SriLanka/Detail">Crime and Safety Report</a>&#8239;for Sri Lanka.&#8239;</li> <li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for&#8239;emergency situations.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued after periodic review with updates to security information.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Iraq due to <b>terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and Mission Iraq&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks to their safety and security, including the potential for violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad and other major cities. Consular services to U.S. citizens in Iraq are limited to emergency services due to severe restrictions on the movements of U.S. government personnel.</p> <p>Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turning violent.</p> <p>Do not travel near Iraq&#8217;s northern borders due to the continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups, armed conflict, aerial bombardment, and civil unrest. U.S. citizens should especially avoid areas near armed groups in northern Iraq, which have been targeted with aerial strikes by neighboring countries&#8217; militaries.</p> <p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of or supporting designated terrorist organizations is a crime under U.S. law that can result in prison sentences and large fines in the United States.</p> <p>Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport. Due to risks to civil aviation operating in the Baghdad Flight Information Region, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has extended for an additional two years its Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) prohibiting certain flights at altitudes below 32,000 feet. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#Iraq">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.</a></p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iraq.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Iraq.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Iraq:</p> <ul> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li> <li>Read&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, and read the&nbsp;<a href="https://iq.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">U.S. Embassy's web page</a>&nbsp;for country-specific COVID-19 information.</li> <li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)</a>&nbsp;to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a><u> </u>and <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iraq.html#ExternalPopup">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a><u> </u>for Iraq.</li> <li>Visit the CDC website for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li> <li>Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

In addition, terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen.

Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.</p> <p>Military conflict has caused significant destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.</p> <p>Cholera is present throughout Yemen. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.</p> <p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping, and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual national Yemeni-Americans. Rebel groups in Sana&#8217;a have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty &#8211; including lengthy delays &#8211; when attempting to depart Yemen.</p> <p>Some companies outside of Yemen have misrepresented the security situation on the Yemeni island of Socotra and are offering tourist visits there, including by facilitating unofficial and invalid &quot;visas.&quot; Only the sovereign Republic of Yemen Government can issue valid Yemeni visas. Private companies or third countries that arrange such visits are putting tourists in danger. U.S. citizens should not travel to Socotra or any other part of Yemen.</p> <p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Yemen.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Yemen.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Yemen:</p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.</li> <li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.</li> <li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.</li> <li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.</li> <li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Updated to reflect changes to U.S. Embassy Port au Prince operational status.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Haiti due to <b>kidnapping</b>,<b> crime, and civil unrest</b>.&nbsp; <b>U.S. citizens should depart Haiti now in light of the current security and health situation and infrastructure challenges.</b>&nbsp; U.S. citizens wishing to depart Port-au-Prince should monitor local news and only do so when considered safe.</p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Kidnapping is widespread, and victims regularly include U.S. citizens. Kidnappers may use sophisticated planning or take advantage of unplanned opportunities, and even convoys have been attacked. Kidnapping cases often involve ransom negotiations and U.S. citizen victims have been physically harmed during kidnappings. Victims&#8217; families have paid thousands of dollars to rescue their family members. Violent crime, such as armed robbery and carjacking, is common. Travelers are sometimes followed and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. Robbers and carjackers also attack private vehicles stuck in heavy traffic congestion and often target lone drivers, particularly women. As a result, the U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport. Protests, demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and can turn violent. The U.S. government is extremely limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Haiti &#8211; assistance on site is available only from local authorities (Haitian National Police and ambulance services). Local police generally lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. U.S. government personnel are discouraged from walking in Port-au-Prince and other neighborhoods. Only adult family members over the age of 18 are permitted to accompany U.S. government employees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. U.S. government personnel in Haiti are prohibited from:</p> <ul> <li>Visiting establishments after dark without secure, on-site parking;</li> <li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis;</li> <li>Visiting banks and using ATMs;</li> <li>Personnel are limited only to the confined area around the Embassy after dark;</li> <li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.</li> <li>Visiting certain parts of the city at any time without prior approval and special security measures in place.</li> </ul> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Haiti.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for additional information on travel to Haiti.</p> <p>The Haitian Ministry of Health and Population (MSPP) has confirmed an outbreak of cholera in the country. &nbsp;The MSPP recommends that individuals adopt public health safety measures, including hand washing and drinking potable, treated or bottled water.&nbsp; Visit the CDC page for the <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">latest&nbsp;Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:</p> <ul> <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, and read the&nbsp;<a href="https://ht.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for country-specific COVID-19 information.&nbsp;</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.

Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police, targets.

Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.</p> <p>Pakistan&#8217;s security environment remains fluid sometimes changing with little or no notice. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks occur less frequently in major urban areas than other parts of Pakistan.</p> <p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.</p> <p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.</p> <p>Read the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Pakistan.html">country information page</a> for additional information on travel to Pakistan.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined Pakistan has a low level of COVID-19.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information.</i></b></p> <p>Do not travel to Libya due to&nbsp;<b>crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping,&nbsp;</b>and<b>&nbsp;armed conflict.</b></p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. Westerners and U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.</p> <p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Libya. Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials and citizens. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities.</p> <p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, Sabha, and Dernah, have witnessed fighting among armed groups, as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels and airports frequented by Westerners have been the targets of these attacks. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.</p> <p>Militia or armed groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or a legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Reissued after periodic review.</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to Lebanon due to<b>&#8239;crime,</b>&#8239;<b>terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest, kidnapping&#8239;</b>and<b>&#8239;Embassy Beirut&#8217;s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens.&nbsp;</b>Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.</p> <p>Do Not Travel to:</p> <ul> <li>the border with Syria due to&#8239;<b>terrorism</b>&#8239;<b>and</b>&#8239;<b>armed conflict</b></li> <li>&nbsp;the border with Israel due to&#8239;<b>the potential for</b>&#8239;<b>armed conflict</b></li> <li>refugee settlements due to&#8239;<b>the potential for</b>&#8239;<b>armed clashes</b></li> </ul> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Local security authorities have noted a rise in violent crimes, including political violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically motivated. U.S. citizens living and working anywhere in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and review their personal security plans.</p> <p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.</p> <p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.</p> <p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Armed clashes have occurred along the borders, in Beirut, and in refugee settlements. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have been brought in to quell the violence in these situations.</p> <p>U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings or protests as some of these have turned violent. Protesters have blocked major roads, including thoroughfares between downtown Beirut and the area where the U.S. Embassy is located, and between Beirut and Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport.</p> <p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.</p> <p>Read the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Lebanon.html">country information page</a>&#8239;for additional information on travel to Lebanon.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to Lebanon:&#8239;&#8239;</p> <ul> <li>Visit our website for information on &#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas</a>.</li> <li>Avoid demonstrations and crowds.</li> <li>Stay alert in locations frequented by Westerners.</li> <li>Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.</li> <li>Enroll in the&#8239;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&#8239;(<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">STEP</a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.</li> <li>Follow the Department of State on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TravelGov">Twitter</a>.</li> <li>Review the&#8239;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report">Country Security Report</a>&#8239;for Lebanon.</li> <li>Visit the CDC page for the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list">Travel Health Information</a>&nbsp;related to your travel.</li> <li>Read&#8239;the&#8239;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s&#8239;COVID-19 page</a>&#8239;before planning any international travel and read the Embassy's&#8239;<a href="https://lb.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/">COVID-19 page</a>&#8239;for country-specific COVID-19 information.&#8239;</li> <li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b>Last Updated: Reissued with updates to health information</b></p> <p>See state summaries and advisory levels below for information on your specific travel destination. Some areas of Mexico have increased risk of crime and kidnapping.</p> <p><b>Country Summary</b>: Violent crime &#8211; such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery &#8211; is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or restricted. In many states, local emergency services are limited outside the state capital or major cities.</p> <p>U.S. citizens are advised to adhere to restrictions on U.S. government employee travel. State-specific restrictions are included in the individual state advisories below. U.S. government employees may not travel between cities after dark, may not hail taxis on the street, and must rely on dispatched vehicles, including app-based services like Uber, and regulated taxi stands. U.S. government employees should avoid traveling alone, especially in remote areas. U.S. government employees may not drive from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior parts of Mexico, except daytime travel within Baja California and between Nogales and Hermosillo on Mexican Federal Highway 15D, and between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey on Highway 85D.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a

                <![CDATA[ <p>Worldwide Cautions provide U.S. citizens with general information regarding terrorist activities, political violence, and criminal activity that occur abroad, as well as specific recommendations on how to prepare for possible contingencies, receive information on breaking security events and ensure that travelers can be contacted in an emergency. This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated January 15, 2019.</p> <p>The Department of State remains concerned about the continued threat of terrorist attacks, demonstrations, and other violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests overseas. The Department of State believes there is a higher potential for anti-American violence given the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri on July 31, 2022. Current information suggests that terrorist organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in multiple regions across the globe. These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics including suicide operations, assassinations, kidnappings, hijackings, and bombings.</p> <p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities, and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. &nbsp;U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. &nbsp;In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. &nbsp;U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.&nbsp;</p> <p>When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories</a>&nbsp;and information pages on&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html">travel.state.gov</a>.&nbsp; Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&nbsp;<a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program</a>&nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate them in an emergency. &nbsp;The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. &nbsp;In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&nbsp; <b>1 (888) 407-4747</b>&nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&nbsp;<b>1 (202) 501-4444</b>&nbsp;from other countries.</p> <p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. &nbsp;U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;</p> <p>For further information:</p> <ul> <li>See the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.state.gov/">Department of State's travel website</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html">Worldwide Caution</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html">country information</a>.</li> <li>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>.</li> <li>The Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) provides several resources to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. private sector abroad.

                <![CDATA[ <p><b><i>Last Update: Reissued with updates to health information</i></b></p> <p>Reconsider travel to the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) and the PRC&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) due to&nbsp;<b>arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-19-related restrictions.</b>&nbsp; Exercise increased caution in the PRC due to&nbsp;<b>wrongful detentions</b>.</p> <p>Read the Department of State&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page before you plan any international travel.</p> <p><b><u>Quarantine and Testing</u></b></p> <p>The zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 by the PRC and Hong Kong SAR governments severely impacts travel and access to public services.</p> <p>All travelers should prepare to quarantine at a government-designated location for an extended duration upon arrival. While in quarantine, health authorities will test travelers as often as daily for COVID-19 and will not permit travelers to leave their rooms. Travelers who test positive during this quarantine time will be transferred to a government-designated medical facility. Standards of care, accommodations, testing, and treatments may differ considerably from standards in the United States, including the possibility of unsanitary or crowded conditions, substandard or limited access to food provisions, and delayed access to medical treatment. Even after completing quarantine on-arrival, travelers to the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR, may face additional quarantines and mandatory testing as well as movement and access restrictions, including access to medical services and public transportation. In some cases, U.S. citizen children in the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR, who test positive have been separated from their parents and kept in isolation until they meet local hospital discharge requirements.</p> <p>People within the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR, are subjected to mandatory testing. In areas with confirmed COVID-19 cases, restrictions may include being confined to home or moved to a government- designated quarantine facility or hospital. </p> <p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/">Embassy's COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page for more information on COVID-19 and related restrictions and conditions in the mainland areas of the PRC, or the&nbsp;<a href="https://hk.usconsulate.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">Consulate General Hong Kong's COVID-19</a>&nbsp;page for information on the COVID-19 situation in the Hong Kong SAR, as testing and travel requirements frequently change.</p> <p><b><u>COVID-19 Vaccine Information</u></b></p> <p>The Department does not provide direct medical care to private U.S. citizens abroad, and U.S. citizens overseas may receive vaccine doses where they are eligible according to national vaccination plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Chinese government has conditionally authorized several different vaccines that are currently available to foreigners residing in China. The two most commonly available, Sinopharm and Sinovac, have not yet received approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. Sinopharm and Sinovac have received approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO). Please contact your local health authorities for information on available vaccines.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines">FDA&#8217;s website</a> to learn more about FDA-approved vaccines in the United States.</p> <p><b><u>Lockdowns</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Lockdowns, also called &#8220;dynamic static management of COVID-19 risks,&#8221; can occur in any location in the PRC at any time with little notice and may last for extended periods.&nbsp; Officials may instruct people not to leave specific districts, compounds, or residences. They may lock compound and building doors, and construct gates or walls around residences with little or no notice.&nbsp; Officials may require people to transfer to a quarantine facility.&nbsp; Prepare to have sufficient water, food, and medication on hand for a minimum of two weeks.&nbsp; If an area is restricted due to COVID-19, groceries, deliveries, and public transportation may be unavailable. Hospitals may restrict entrance or be locked down on short notice. These restrictions may be more likely to occur in border areas, particularly on the borders with the DPRK, Burma (Myanmar), Mongolia, and Russia, where COVID-19 cases have occurred that officials believe stem from cross border transmission.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Country Summary:&nbsp;</b>The PRC government arbitrarily enforces local laws, including carrying out wrongful detentions and using exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without fair and transparent process under the law.</p> <p>The Department has determined that at least one U.S. national is wrongfully detained by the PRC government.</p> <p>U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR, may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law.</p> <p>Foreigners in the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR, including but not limited to businesspeople, former foreign government personnel, and journalists have been unjustly interrogated and detained by PRC officials for alleged violations of PRC national security laws. The PRC has also interrogated, detained, and expelled U.S. citizens living and working in the PRC.</p> <p>Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC or Hong Kong SAR governments.</p> <p>In addition, the PRC government has used restrictions on travel or departure from the PRC, or so-called exit bans, to:</p> <ul> <li>compel individuals to participate in PRC government investigations,</li> <li>pressure family members of the restricted individual to return to the PRC from abroad,</li> <li>resolve civil disputes in favor of PRC citizens, and</li> <li>gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.</li> </ul> <p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of an exit ban when they attempt to depart the PRC, and there is no reliable mechanism or legal process to find out how long the ban might continue or to contest it in a court of law. &nbsp;Relatives, including minor children, of those under investigation in the PRC, may become subject to an exit ban.&nbsp;</p> <p>The PRC and Hong Kong SAR governments do not recognize dual nationality. &nbsp;U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and the PRC and Hong Kong SAR governments may prevent the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General from providing consular services.</p> <p><b>XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION and TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION</b></p> <p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uyghur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.</p> <p><b>HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION</b></p> <p>Since the imposition of the National Security Law on June 30, 2020, the PRC unilaterally and arbitrarily exercises police and security power in the Hong Kong SAR. The PRC has demonstrated an intention to use this authority to target a broad range of activities it defines as acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign entities. The National Security Law also covers offenses committed by non-Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S. citizens who have been publicly critical of the PRC to a heightened risk of arrest, detention, expulsion, or prosecution. PRC security forces, including the new Office for Safeguarding National Security, now operate in the Hong Kong SAR and are not subject to oversight by the Hong Kong judiciary.</p> <p><b>Demonstrations</b>: Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. On June 30, 2020, as part of its color-coded system of warning flags, the Hong Kong police unveiled a new purple flag, which warns protesters that shouting slogans or carrying banners with an intent prohibited by the law could now result in criminal charges. U.S. citizens are strongly cautioned to be aware of their surroundings and avoid demonstrations.</p> <p><b>Propaganda</b>: A PRC propaganda campaign has falsely accused individuals, including U.S. citizens, of fomenting unrest in the Hong Kong SAR. In some cases, the campaign has published their personal information, resulting in threats of violence on social media.</p> <p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/China.html">country information page</a>&nbsp;for the PRC and the<u>&nbsp;</u><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/HongKong.html">information page&nbsp;</a>for the Hong Kong SAR for additional information on travel.</p> <p>If you decide to travel to the PRC, including the Hong Kong SAR:</p> <ul> <li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/covid-19-travel-information.html">Department of State&#8217;s COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;before planning any international travel, read the&nbsp;<a href="https://china.usembassy-china.org.cn/covid-19-information/?_ga=2.120372872.167054240.1647399637-1564366313.1646718901">Embassy COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for the PRC and the&nbsp;<a href="https://hk.usconsulate.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">Consulate General COVID-19 page</a>&nbsp;for the Hong Kong SAR for specific COVID-19 information.</li> <li>For the Hong Kong SAR, monitor local media, local transportations sites and apps like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mtr.com.hk/mtrmobile/en/">MTR Mobile</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bravobus.com.hk/home/default.aspx?intLangID=1">CitybusNWFB</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page">Hong Kong International Airport website</a>&nbsp;for updates.</li> <li>Avoid the areas of the demonstrations.</li> <li>Exercise caution if you are in the vicinity of large gatherings or protests.</li> <li>Avoid taking photographs of protesters or police without permission.</li> <li>Be aware of your surroundings.</li> <li>Keep a low profile.</li> <li>For the Hong Kong SAR, review your Hong Kong flight status with your airline or at the Hong Kong International Airport&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hongkongairport.com/en/flights/departures/passenger.page">website.</a></li> <li>Enter the PRC on your U.S. passport with a valid PRC visa and keep it with you.</li> <li>If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately.</li> <li>If you plan to enter the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), read the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/KoreaDemocraticPeoplesRepublicof.html">DPRK Travel Advisory</a>.
