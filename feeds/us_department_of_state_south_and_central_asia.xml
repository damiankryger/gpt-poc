					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to have Foreign Minister Momen here with us today at the State Department, and important to take account of the fact that the relationship between Bangladesh and the United States has grown tremendously over the last 50 years – economically, our people-to-people ties, work that we’ve been doing more recently on everything from climate to health, which we very much value.  And we also deeply appreciate Bangladesh’s remarkable generosity to more than 1 million Rohingya refugees that they have been taking care of.</p>
<p>We’re committed to continuing to work together, to find ways to strengthen and deepen the relationship, to address as well economic development and human rights.  And of course, we’re looking – the world is looking – to Bangladesh for its next elections, to make sure that they set a strong example for free and fair elections for the region and for the world.</p>
<p>But Abdul, welcome.  It’s very good to have you here.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MOMEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you, Secretary of State, for your invitation to meet you to strengthen our relationship between U.S. and Bangladesh and to solidify the relationship.  I am so thankful to you.  And Bangladesh and USA has multifaceted, dynamic, and wide-ranging relationship.  And over the last 50 years we have done really well, and we look forward to future 50 years.</p>
<p>Recently, when we were observing our 51st anniversary independence day, President Biden sent a very warm letter to our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  And he stated, and I quote, “USA and Bangladesh achieved a lot together.”  He ended his letter with a very special word, and it is – the word is, <em>Joy Bangla</em>.  Means, “Victory to Bangladesh.”  It signifies our sacrifice of 3 million lives for our independence, for upholding democracy, human rights, justice, and human dignity.  We are thankful to President Biden, and our prime minister has also sent a letter to him which I shall hand over to you today.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, you also made a wonderful statement during our independence, and I would like to quote you.  You said, “Bangladesh has many reasons to be proud .  With a rapidly growing economy, an increasingly well-educated workforce, and a dynamic youth demographic, Bangladesh is quickly becoming a regional leader.”  You added, “The United States is proud of its partnership with Bangladesh and of the resulting achievements made over the last five decades.  Most , we have made real strides together battling COVID-19.”</p>
<p>I agree with you.  You are also the – we need to all achieve with your support and active partnership, and we are proud of your partnership.  And we look beyond in the future, so that we can have more better days in future.</p>
<p>I am here to develop, strengthen, and solidify our relationship.  Thank you, Your Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, everyone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of the United States of America and the Kyrgyz Republic on the occasion of United States-Kyrgyz Republic Annual Bilateral Consultations (ABCs) in Washington.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text</em></p>
<p>On March 30, 2023, U.S. Department of State Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu and Kyrgyz Republic Deputy Foreign Minister Aibek Moldogaziev led a successful fifth round of United States-Kyrgyz Republic Annual Bilateral Consultations in Washington.  The Annual Bilateral Consultations are an opportunity to deepen the U.S.-Kyrgyz partnership by discussing shared perspectives, advancing bilateral goals, and promoting a more prosperous Central Asia.</p>
<p>The United States underscored its commitment to the Kyrgyz Republic&#8217;s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.  Assistant Secretary Lu highlighted the growing partnership between the two countries, building on Secretary Blinken’s fruitful February-March visit to the region and a bilateral meeting with Foreign Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic Zheenbek Kulubaev.</p>
<p><strong>Political and Security Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>The United States thanked the Kyrgyz Republic for its leadership in regional integration efforts and its upcoming role as annual co-chair of the C5+1 Secretariat beginning in July 2023.  The two countries’ representatives also discussed the successful repatriation and reintegration of 59 Kyrgyz citizens from Syria, border security and assistance, and global health security.</p>
<p>The United States welcomed the Kyrgyz Republic’s efforts to delimitate and demarcate its international borders as a central element of peace and security in Central Asia.  Meeting participants discussed how the two countries might simplify visa processing and review the validity period of visas for each other’s citizens.  They also discussed the possibility of increasing employment opportunities for the citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic, including in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Diversification</strong></p>
<p>The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic discussed sanctions coordination and the importance of efforts to reduce the negative impact of international sanctions on the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic.  Both sides shared views on further collaboration in advancing information technology and digital industries.  They also discussed the ways in which the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic can promote English language programming in the Kyrgyz Republic, including by supporting investments in English language learning and the work of Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
<p>The two delegations welcomed the intensification of trade and economic cooperation, including within the framework of the U.S.-Kyrgyz Business Council.  The Kyrgyz delegation noted the importance of helping Kyrgyz banks open correspondent bank accounts with U.S. banks.  Participants discussed ways to promote U.S. investment in the Kyrgyz Republic, Kyrgyz exports to the U.S. market, and cooperation in the field of tourism.  Additionally, the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic shared perspectives on air quality improvement and clean energy goals.</p>
<p><strong>Media Freedom, Democracy, and the Rule of Law</strong></p>
<p>The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic underscored the importance of a free and diverse media space, a strong and vibrant civil society, and the protection of human rights for all, including efforts to promote women’s empowerment as well as combat gender-based violence, including domestic violence – all of which are cornerstones of a healthy and thriving democracy.</p>
<p>The two delegations additionally discussed further collaboration on combating cybercrime and asset recovery.  Participants also discussed the importance of official and non-official visits and exchanges to further bilateral understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>The United States-Kyrgyz Republic Annual Bilateral Consultations underscore the strength of the bilateral partnership and are an opportunity to identify actionable steps to meet bilateral and regional goals.  Assistant Secretary Lu thanked Deputy Foreign Minister Moldogaziev for the Kyrgyz delegation’s participation.  Both sides stated their intention to hold the next round of Annual Bilateral Consultations in Bishkek.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>In December of 2021, I asked Ambassador Dan Smith to lead an After Action Review of the Department of State’s execution of its duties related to ending the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan. The After Action Review covers the period from January 2020 to the end of August 2021 and the completion of the U.S. military withdrawal.  I directed this review because I believe we have an obligation to our workforce, our institution, our partners in Congress, and the American people to learn from the lessons of this chapter in U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>The After Action Review, which we are now making available to relevant Congressional committees, produced a series of findings on how the Department planned for and carried out its missions during this period. It also provided detailed recommendations that we are already taking steps to implement. These include strengthening the Department’s overall contingency planning, crisis preparedness, and response capabilities.</p>
<p>The State Department’s greatest asset is its people, including an extraordinary group of dedicated and talented professionals who worked tirelessly on the ground in Kabul, in Washington, and at other sites domestically and abroad to evacuate and assist as many people as possible during that period. Their efforts, and the efforts of all from our Department who served in Afghanistan over two decades as well our Afghan partners who served alongside them, deserve our highest praise and gratitude, and we continue to honor them through our work  going forward.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I would like to convey my warmest congratulations to the people of Bangladesh on your Independence Day.</p>
<p>As you celebrate your 53rd Independence Day, Bangladesh has many reasons to be proud. With a rapidly growing economy, an increasingly well-educated workforce, and a dynamic youth demographic, Bangladesh is quickly becoming a regional leader. By generously welcoming Rohingya fleeing genocide, you have demonstrated your humanitarian commitment to sheltering vulnerable refugees. By developing adaptation strategies to the climate crisis, you have shown leadership in protecting the environment and strengthening climate resilience.</p>
<p>The United States is proud of its partnership with Bangladesh and of the resulting achievements made over the last five decades. Most recently, we have made real strides together battling COVID-19, tackling climate change, and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region. We commit to working with you in support of free and fair elections, open to all. By committing to democratic norms, good governance, human rights, and media freedom—all of which are hallmarks of developing, stable, and prospering societies—I believe Bangladesh will achieve its great potential.</p>
<p>Americans and Bangladeshis are stronger together because of our cooperation on the defining issues of this era. I look forward to deepening our partnership in the year ahead.</p>

		<title>Additional Humanitarian Assistance for the Burma and Bangladesh Regional Crisis</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>During the launch of the 2023 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in Bangladesh today, the Department of State announced nearly $26 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and the region, for those people in Burma affected by ongoing violence, and for communities hosting refugees from Burma.  With this new funding, our total assistance for those affected by the Rakhine State and Rohingya crisis has reached nearly $2.1 billion since August 2017, when over 740,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to safety in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.</p>
<p>This new funding includes nearly $24 million for programs specifically in Bangladesh, providing life-sustaining support to nearly 980,000 Rohingya refugees, many of them survivors of genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing, and support to nearly 540,000 host community members in Bangladesh.  This assistance sees to it that children and young adults have access to education and vocational training, provides families with food and clean water, strengthens sanitation systems to prevent the spread of disease, supports the protection of Rohingya refugees’ human rights and well-being, bolsters disaster preparedness, and helps combat the effects of climate change.  We urge other donors to contribute robustly to the humanitarian response and increase support to those driven from and affected by violence in Burma.</p>
<p>The United States recognizes the generosity of the government and people of Bangladesh and other countries hosting refugees from Burma in the region particularly given that this is the sixth year of this protracted crisis.  We are committed to finding lasting solutions to this crisis, including the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return and reintegration of displaced Rohingya when conditions in Burma allow.  An essential step in ending this crisis is ending the military regime’s brutal repression of its people and agreeing to a pathway to an inclusive multiparty democracy. We commend our humanitarian partners for the lifesaving work they continue to do every day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>The text of the following joint statement was agreed upon by the Special Representatives and Envoys for Afghanistan of Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States following their meeting in Paris held February 20, 2023. </em></p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>Special Envoys and Representatives for Afghanistan of Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States met in Paris on February 20, 2023 to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA); Country Director for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan also participated in the meeting as observers.</p>
<p>The Special Envoys and Representatives for Afghanistan:<s></s></p>
<p>1.     Noted with grave concern the increased threat to security and stability in Afghanistan and the deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation, with more than 28 million Afghans now in need of humanitarian aid, of whom more than half are women and children, and six million just one step from famine.</p>
<p>2.     Emphasized their concern about increasing deterioration and multiple violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of Afghans by the Taliban since August 2021, especially those of women and girls as well as members of ethnic and religious minorities and other marginalized groups;</p>
<p>2.1     Strongly condemned the Taliban’s decisions in December 2022 to ban Afghan women from university education and from working in NGOs, which follow numerous other harmful violations and restrictions imposed on opportunities for women to exercise their rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021, including to continue to ban girls from secondary schools, thus excluding them from all spheres of public life;</p>
<p>2.2     Affirmed that these decisions violate and threaten not only Afghan women’s rights and freedoms, but also the overall much-needed social and economic development of the country, which will suffer greatly if half of the population is excluded from participating meaningfully; emphasized that humanitarian assistance cannot be delivered fairly or effectively if limited by discriminatory policies or practices;</p>
<p>2.3     Called for the immediate reversal of these unacceptable bans as they are preventing humanitarian assistance from reaching Afghans most in need.</p>
<p>3.       Recalled the Taliban’s responsibility for the deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation, as well as their responsibility for the recovery of the country and the improvement of the economic situation; recalled that responding to the needs of the Afghan people should be the main preoccupation of the Taliban.</p>
<p>4.      Expressed grave concern about the increasing threat of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, including ISKP, Al Qaeda, Tehrik-i-Taliban-Pakistan and others, which deeply affects security and stability inside the country, in the region and beyond, and called on the Taliban to uphold Afghanistan’s obligation to deny these groups safe haven.</p>
<p>5.      Underscored that achieving peace and stability in Afghanistan requires a credible and inclusive national dialogue leading to a constitutional order with a representative and inclusive political system.</p>
<p>6.       Emphasized that the UN Security Council has set out the international community’s clear expectations of the Taliban in UNSCR 2593 (2021) and subsequent resolutions which are critical for peace and stability in the country and for normalization of relations with the international community:  (1) full efforts to ensure Afghan territory is not used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist acts; (2) unhindered and safe access for the United Nations and humanitarian actors in delivering services and assistance; (3) respect for the human rights of all Afghans, including women and members of minority groups; (4) pursuit of an inclusive negotiated political settlement and rule of law with the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women; and (5) safe passage and freedom to travel for those who wish to travel abroad.</p>
<p>7.      Paid tribute to the work of the United Nations and of UN Special Rapporteur Richard Bennett; recognized the important and specific work of UNAMA, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the many NGOs and other humanitarian actors that continue to support the people of Afghanistan and help them through a very difficult social and humanitarian crisis; reasserted that NGOs are best placed to make their own operational decisions, consistent with Inter-Agency Standing Committee principles and donors’ principles and in accordance with their respective evaluation of safety and security conditions in the country.</p>
<p>8.      Highlighted the necessity to continue helping Afghans who are suffering in this humanitarian crisis with appropriate consideration for vulnerable populations, including women and women-led households, children and members of ethnic and religious minority communities; underscored that international assistance to Afghanistan is destined only for the benefit of the people of Afghanistan, should be delivered free from interference, and is not a sign of progress toward normalization of relations with the Taliban.</p>
<p>9.      Emphasized the need for continued engagement with neighboring countries and other countries of the region to further deepen coordination on a joint response to the developing situation in Afghanistan, including countering potential threats to regional security and stability emanating from Afghanistan; commended the efforts of Muslim-majority countries and the OIC in engaging with the Taliban on women’s rights and welcomed the leadership they have demonstrated on issues such as access to education.</p>
<p>10.     Stated that the situation and developments in Afghanistan should be constantly observed with the utmost vigilance and that coordination among members of the international community should be maintained and reinforced in light of future developments in Afghanistan and with the interest of the people of Afghanistan in mind.</p>
<p>11.     Expressed their appreciation to France for organizing these consultations and hosting the meeting; and looked forward to this Group of Special Envoys and Representatives meeting again in the near future.</p>
