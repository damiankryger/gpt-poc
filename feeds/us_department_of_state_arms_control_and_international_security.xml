					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following text is a joint statement by the U.S. Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim, the Republic of Korea (ROK) Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Kim Gunn, and Japanese Director-General of the Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Funakoshi Takehiro, following a trilateral meeting on April 7, 2023, in Seoul.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text. </em></p>
<p>We strongly condemn the DPRK’s repeated ballistic missile launches as well as its escalatory and destabilizing rhetoric related to the use of nuclear weapons. We express deep regret that the DPRK continues to ignore the hardship of its people, choosing instead to pour its scarce resources into its WMD and ballistic missile programs in clear violation of multiple United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. We commit ourselves to further strengthening and diversifying security cooperation to counter the threat the DPRK poses to regional and global security. The U.S. Special Representative reiterates that the U.S. commitments to defend the ROK and Japan are ironclad.</p>
<p>We urge the DPRK to abide by its obligations under all relevant UNSC resolutions and call on all UN Member States to fully implement the UNSC resolutions. In particular, we underscore that in accordance with UNSC resolution 2397 (2017), UN Member States are required to repatriate all DPRK laborers earning income in their jurisdictions, unless repatriation is prohibited by applicable national or international law. UN Member States should be vigilant and ensure that no work authorizations are renewed or granted to overseas DPRK laborers consistent with UNSC resolution 2375 (2017) and address the DPRK’s attempts to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>We reiterate with concern that overseas DPRK IT workers continue using forged identities and nationalities to evade UNSC sanctions and earn income abroad that funds the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. We are also deeply concerned about how the DPRK supports these programs by stealing and laundering funds as well as gathering information through malicious cyber activities. According to the UN Panel of Experts, the DPRK attempted to steal as much as $2 billion between 2015 and 2019 through cyber means. According to private industry estimates, the DPRK stole up to $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency in 2022 alone. We highlight the importance of our joint efforts to block such illicit revenue streams.</p>
<p>We deplore the human rights violations and abuses in the DPRK and underscore the importance of strengthening cooperation to improve the human rights situation in the DPRK. We express serious concern over the issue of enforced disappearances including the abductions of citizens of the ROK and Japan by the DPRK, as well as unrepatriated prisoners of war. In this regard, we commit to work together to achieve an immediate resolution to the abductions issue, as well as an immediate release of ROK citizens detained in the DPRK.</p>
<p>We reaffirm that the path to dialogue remains open, as demonstrated by repeated attempts to engage the DPRK in dialogue, and urge the DPRK to return to negotiations rather than engage in unlawful, provocative, and escalatory actions. To this end, the U.S. and Japanese Special Representatives express support for the goal of the ROK&#8217;s &#8220;Audacious Initiative.”</p>

		<title>Russian Noncompliance with and Invalid Suspension of the New START Treaty</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Russia’s noncompliance with the New START Treaty, and its claimed suspension of the treaty, are unfortunate and irresponsible steps.  Mutual compliance with New START strengthens the security of the United States, our allies and partners, Russia, and the world.  Russia’s claimed suspension of the New START Treaty is legally invalid.  As a result, Russia remains bound by its obligations under the treaty.  The United States remains ready to work constructively with Russia to fully implement the treaty.  Below are the facts about the current state of the treaty:</p>
<p><strong>Fact: Russia can easily remedy its current and clear noncompliance with the New START Treaty</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Russia’s noncompliance is clear:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Russia is refusing to allow inspections. The treaty requires each Party to accept 18 inspections per year.  Inspections strengthen nuclear stability by giving both sides confidence that the treaty’s limits on nuclear weapons are being respected.</li>
<li>Russia refuses to meet in the treaty’s implementation body, the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC), despite repeated U.S. requests. The treaty requires both sides meet in the BCC.  This also is an important element of nuclear stability.  It provides a channel for experts to engage in constructive discussion and resolve technical questions of treaty implementation in a mutually beneficial way.</li>
<li>Russia has stopped providing its treaty-mandated notifications. The treaty requires each side to provide data and notifications, including on the status and movement of its accountable nuclear forces.  Mutual compliance with these obligations is an important element of nuclear stability.  It provides significant transparency and predictability regarding strategic nuclear forces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Russia’s noncompliance threatens the viability of the treaty. While the United States assessed that Russia did not engage in significant activity above the treaty limits in 2022, Russia’s failure to allow inspections and provide notifications degrades U.S. ability to assess Russian nuclear deployments.</li>
<li>Russia can easily remedy its noncompliance by resuming activities it conducted for years under the treaty: host inspections, meet in the BCC, and provide notifications and data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: There is nothing preventing Russia from conducting inspections on U.S. territory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the easing of COVID-related restrictions, the United States has made it crystal clear to Russia that we are prepared to host Russian inspectors.</li>
<li>Russia has everything it needs to conduct inspections on U.S. territory, and the United States would welcome a Russian inspection team, per the terms of the treaty.</li>
<li>Russian inspectors have the necessary visas, Russian treaty-designated airplanes have viable air routes to transport inspectors to the United States, inspectors can also use commercial air travel to reach U.S. territory, and there are no sanctions that prevent Russia from fully exercising its inspection rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: The United States remains in full compliance with the New START Treaty</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Russia has claimed that U.S. conversion procedures for its submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launchers and B-52H heavy bombers are not consistent with U.S. obligations under the New START Treaty.</li>
<li>These claims are false.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The U.S. conversion procedures for SLBM launchers and heavy bombers render the converted items incapable of employing nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>The United States has declared and demonstrated the procedures and exhibited the converted items to Russia, just as the treaty requires.</li>
<li>Russia has the treaty right to inspect converted items to confirm the results of the conversions as the United States exhibited them to Russia. It is up to Russia to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Russia acknowledged publicly, the United States has gone beyond the requirements of the treaty to address Russian concerns with SLBM launcher conversions. After careful and constructive work, both sides reached a mutual understanding on additional voluntary measures to address those concerns.  The United States welcomes Russian inspections during which Russia can take advantage of these measures.</li>
<li>Russia’s accusations of U.S. noncompliance are baseless attempts to distract from Russia’s own actions, and do not provide Russia a valid legal basis to suspend the treaty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: </strong><strong>The United States remains ready to meet and discuss U.S. and Russian compliance concerns and all other issues related to implementation of the treaty.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States was ready to work constructively with Russia at the BCC session that was scheduled for November 2022, which Russia abruptly canceled. Contrary to Russian claims, all topics Russia identified for discussion were on the agenda.</li>
<li>We remain ready for constructive engagement today. Such engagement is an important element of nuclear stability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: Russia’s war in Ukraine does not provide a valid basis for Russian noncompliance with the New START Treaty </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The strong U.S. and international response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine does not absolve Russia of responsibility to fulfill its legal obligations under New START.</li>
<li>Russia’s noncompliance and purported suspension of the New START Treaty will not stop the United States from continuing to fully support Ukraine. That reality is irrelevant to the utility of the treaty and Russia’s ability to continue participation in it.</li>
<li>New START inspection activities do not threaten Russian security. The treaty provides both sides with the means to ensure the safety and security of inspected facilities.</li>
<li>Nuclear stability is especially important in time of crisis, and the United States will continue working to maintain it.</li>

<p><strong>Fact: The United States remains in full compliance with the New START Treaty</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Russia has claimed that U.S. conversion procedures for its submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launchers and B-52H heavy bombers are not consistent with U.S. obligations under the New START Treaty.</li>
<li>These claims are false.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The U.S. conversion procedures for SLBM launchers and heavy bombers render the converted items incapable of employing nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>The United States has declared and demonstrated the procedures and exhibited the converted items to Russia, just as the treaty requires.</li>
<li>Russia has the treaty right to inspect converted items to confirm the results of the conversions as the United States exhibited them to Russia. It is up to Russia to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As Russia acknowledged publicly, the United States has gone beyond the requirements of the treaty to address Russian concerns with SLBM launcher conversions. After careful and constructive work, both sides reached a mutual understanding on additional voluntary measures to address those concerns.  The United States welcomes Russian inspections during which Russia can take advantage of these measures.</li>
<li>Russia’s accusations of U.S. noncompliance are baseless attempts to distract from Russia’s own actions, and do not provide Russia a valid legal basis to suspend the treaty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: </strong><strong>The United States remains ready to meet and discuss U.S. and Russian compliance concerns and all other issues related to implementation of the treaty.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States was ready to work constructively with Russia at the BCC session that was scheduled for November 2022, which Russia abruptly canceled. Contrary to Russian claims, all topics Russia identified for discussion were on the agenda.</li>
<li>We remain ready for constructive engagement today. Such engagement is an important element of nuclear stability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fact: Russia’s war in Ukraine does not provide a valid basis for Russian noncompliance with the New START Treaty </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The strong U.S. and international response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine does not absolve Russia of responsibility to fulfill its legal obligations under New START.</li>
<li>Russia’s noncompliance and purported suspension of the New START Treaty will not stop the United States from continuing to fully support Ukraine. That reality is irrelevant to the utility of the treaty and Russia’s ability to continue participation in it.</li>
<li>New START inspection activities do not threaten Russian security. The treaty provides both sides with the means to ensure the safety and security of inspected facilities.</li>
<li>Nuclear stability is especially important in time of crisis, and the United States will continue working to maintain it.</li>

		<title>U.S. Department of State Concludes $20,000,000 Settlement of Alleged Export Violations by 3D Systems Corporation</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State has concluded an administrative settlement with 3D Systems Corporation (3D) of Rock Hill, South Carolina, to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 et seq., and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130.  The Department of State and 3D have reached this settlement following an extensive compliance review by the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance in the Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.</p>
<p>The Department of State and 3D have reached an agreement pursuant to ITAR § 128.11 to address alleged ITAR violations occurring during the period of 2012 – 2018 involving unauthorized exports of technical data to Germany, unauthorized exports and retransfers of technical data to the People’s Republic of China (PRC), a proscribed destination under ITAR § 126.1, unauthorized reexports of technical data to Taiwan, unauthorized exports of technical data to foreign-person employees, and the failure to maintain ITAR records.</p>
<p>The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting U.S.-origin technical data from unauthorized exports.  The settlement also highlights the importance of obtaining appropriate authorization from the Department before exporting ITAR-controlled technical data.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the 36-month Consent Agreement, 3D Systems Corporation will pay a civil penalty of $20,000,000.  The Department has agreed to suspend $10,000,000 of this amount on the condition that the funds will be used for Department-approved Consent Agreement remedial compliance measures to strengthen 3D’s compliance program.  In addition, the Company will engage an external Special Compliance officer for at least the first year of the Consent Agreement and will conduct two external audits of its ITAR compliance program and implement additional compliance measures.</p>
<p>The Company cooperated with the Department’s review and has been undertaking corrective actions to address this historic conduct by expanding the scope of its internal investigation to cover exports of technical data; implementing remedial compliance measures; selling its business unit primarily responsible for ITAR activity; and signing a statute of limitations agreement tolling the statutory period.  For these reasons, the Department has determined at this time that it is not appropriate to administratively debar 3D Systems Corporation.</p>
<p>The Consent Agreement and related documents will be available for public inspection in the <a title="Original URL: https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAyMjcuNzIzNjUzOTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2ZvaWEuc3RhdGUuZ292L1NlYXJjaC9TZWFyY2guYXNweCJ9.P6xIdMnVkFjj_ED56twdFhau9WCfTI0putNJ8xvA-K8/s/2576317770/br/155203333220-l.

		<title>The U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The <a class="external-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/23/memorandum-on-united-states-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> provides a framework under which U.S. Government agencies review and evaluate proposed arms transfers.  Administrations have long issued such guidance to the Executive Branch agencies, dating back to the first CAT Policy established by the Carter Administration in 1977, and through several subsequent iterations previously promulgated by the Reagan, Clinton, Obama, and Trump Administrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes conventional arms transfers have significant implications for U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. As such the U.S. CAT Policy articulates the priorities and rationale for adjudicating arms transfer decisions, codifying the principles the Administration have been operating under since Day-1.</li>
<li>Building on the October 2022 National Security Strategy, the revised CAT Policy will help establish and maintain strategic partnerships that best reflect the values and interests of the United States. The United States, its Allies, and partners are all stronger and safer when working in concert, and arms transfers are an important mechanism to strengthen partner contributions to global security and reinforce these security relationships.</li>
<li>The revised CAT Policy makes it clear that under this Administration, the United States will utilize a holistic approach to conventional arms transfers and adherence to our agreements on the use of U.S. origin defense equipment by our Allies and partners, compliance with the law of armed conflict, and respect for human rights, and we will take appropriate measures in cases where we conclude that violations have taken place.</li>
<li>The newly revised CAT Policy is committed to strengthening U.S. national security by reinforcing respect for human rights, international humanitarian law, democratic governance, and rule of law, by:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Preventing arms transfers that risk facilitating or otherwise contributing to violations of human rights or international humanitarian law;</li>
<li>Strengthening ally and partner capacity to respect their obligations under international law and reduce the risk of civilian harm, including through U.S. arms transfers bundled with appropriate tools, training, advising, and institutional capacity-building efforts;</li>
<li>Ensuring that arms transfers do not fuel corruption or undermine good governance, while incentivizing effective, transparent, and accountable security sector governance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The revised CAT Policy formalizes longstanding practice that certain Commerce- regulated items, such as firearms and certain military items, including spare parts and components are subject to the CAT Policy framework.</li>
<li>The CAT Policy aligns U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. By doing so, the United States can be both a more effective security partner, as well as build on its global leadership strengthening collective security; promote international peace and stability; reinforce respect for human rights, international humanitarian law, democratic governance, and rule of law; ensure arms transfers do not fuel corruption; and prevent proliferation of equipment and technology that is destabilizing.</li>
<li>In addition to its strengthened focus on human rights and security sector governance, the newly revised CAT Policy also reflects the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s commitment to maintaining a robust and innovative defense industrial base, through a clear and transparent process that promotes a level playing field for U.S. industry. In an increasingly competitive market, the U.S. Government will promote transfers when they are in the U.S. national interest, in line with the considerations of the CAT Policy, and consistent with defense trade advocacy procedures.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Athens, Greece</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong> Mr. Secretary, Putin announced today he would suspend cooperation with <a href="https://www.state.gov/new-start/">New START</a>.  Do you have a reaction and do you see this as a sign he’s going to breach the limits of the treaty?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong> The announcement by Russia that it’s suspending participation in New START is deeply unfortunate and irresponsible.  We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does.  We’ll, of course, make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.</p>
<p>When the administration started, we extended New START because it was clearly in the security interests of our country and actually in the security interests of Russia.  And that only underscores what an irresponsible action this is.</p>
<p>But of course, we remain ready to talk about strategic arms limitations at any time with Russia irrespective of anything else going on in the world or in our relationship.  I think it matters that we continue to act responsibly in this area.  It&#8217;s also something the rest of the world expects of us.  But this decision, as I said, is both really unfortunate and very irresponsible, but we’ll be watching it closely.</p>
<p><strong>MR PATEL:</strong>  Thank you for – thank you, everybody.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">This call is strictly to discuss the OPCW IIT report on the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons in Douma in April 2018.  Ambassador Manso is the U.S. Representative to the OPCW, and he will only take questions during this briefing related to the Douma report.  This briefing is on the record and will be conducted in English with simultaneously Arabic interpretation.  To listen to the call in Arabic, select the Arabic audio channel at the bottom of your screen by clicking the globe icon.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’ll try to get to as many questions as possible in the 30 minutes we have today, so please show your support and like the questions you’d most like us to cover.  You can notify us of any technical difficulties at TheBrusselsHub@state.gov.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And with that, let’s get started.  Ambassador Manso, thank you so much for joining us today.  I’ll turn it over to you for opening remarks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you, Andrea, and thanks to everyone.  Good afternoon and thanks for attending this briefing.  First, I’d like to express my deep condolences for the tragic loss of life in both Türkiye and Syria due to this week’s devastating earthquakes.  It is not lost on us that many of the first responders in Syria now pulling civilians from the rubble were just a few years ago helping civilians who had been burned or suffocated by the Assad regime’s chemical weapons.  The humanity and bravery of these Syrian first responders is astonishing.  We salute them.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier this month, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  It is regrettable that we must continue to express condemnation of the use of chemical weapons.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On January 27, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Investigation and Identification Team – the IIT – released its third report attributing the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and that’s the subject of our discussion today.  The OPCW director-general briefed this report to OPCW delegations last Thursday, February 2nd; and yesterday, February 7th, he briefed the UN Security Council in New York.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The IIT found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Forces dropped two cylinders containing toxic chlorine gas on the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7, 2018.  These weapons hit two residential buildings in a central area of that city, releasing the toxic chemical and killing 43 individuals and affecting countless more.  The report also mentions that the ITT received information that Russian forces were </span><span data-contrast="auto">collocated</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at the Douma Air Base alongside the Tiger Forces at the time of the incident and that the airspace over Douma was exclusively controlled by the Syrian Arab Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defense Forces.  The report clearly refutes Russia’s claim that this was an attack carried out by opposition forces and underscores the lack of cooperation from Russia and Syria to provide information on this attack.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is the fifth separate instance of chemical weapons use that OPCW Investigation and Identification Team has attributed to the Assad regime.  This is in addition to four previous chemical </span><span data-contrast="auto">weapons attacks (inaudible)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism, the JIM, attributed to the Assad regime.  Therefore, the chemical weapons attack in Douma is not an isolated incident.  The Syrian regime has a clear history of using chemical weapons, even after declaring it had given up its chemical weapons program.  The Assad regime’s blatant violations are an affront to the Chemical Weapons Convention and to basic human rights.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The international community must and will continue to work together at both the OPCW and the United Nations to hold the Assad regime to account for its use of chemical weapons against its own population.  Doing so will help restore deterrence against the use of chemical weapons and change the calculus of any state tempted to use chemical weapons in the future.  There must be no impunity for the use of chemical weapons.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you to all of you for being here, and with that, I am happy to take questions.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you very much.  We’ll now turn to the question and answer portion of today’s briefing.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our first question comes from Camille Tawil from Asharq Al-Awsat in the United Kingdom.  And Camille asks, “In light of the chemical weapons use report, what is your message to the nations that are trying to establish links with the regime?  Türkiye and some Arab states seem to be ignoring your objection to dealing with Assad.  What would you say to them?”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Well, thank you for that question.  I think our policy is clear.  The U.S. administration will say that we will not normalize relations with the Assad regime.  We do not support others normalizing relations until there is irreversible progress toward a political resolution to the conflict, in line with Security Council Resolution 2254.  We have not seen that progress to date.  In addition, of course it is U.S. policy to hold accountable those who use chemical weapons, and this is a continuing effort with regard to the Assad regime in Syria and very much continues to be part of U.S. policy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  We’ll now turn to one of our live questions.  We’d like to open a line for Ahmad Zakaria, please.  Ahmad, you can now ask your question.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Hi.  (Inaudible) Al Arabiya.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes, go ahead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  (In Arabic.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Oh, Ahmad, I’m sorry to – so we can only take the question in English, so let me go ahead and ask his question:  “The United States is also a member of the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, which was formed in 2018 and includes 40 countries and the European Union.  What are the options open to this international group to act in the event that the Security Council is unable to impose measures under chapter or clause?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, thank you for that question.  We are indeed members of the International Partnership against Impunity.  I would say here this is part of a – I think a broader issue of what can we do, what can the Partnership against Impunity do, and what can others do to hold the Assad regime accountable?  And this is an important question because often in multilateral diplomacy, our efforts to hold someone accountable and to accomplish something, it’s not just an event; it’s a process.  And I would say there are a number of things that we can do to hold the Assad regime accountable.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And the first thing I would say – and this is certainly also something that the international partnership could do – is to remember and honor the victims.  This report enters into history the research and the evidence that establishes these terrible acts.  It brings to light for the entire international community the truth of what happened to these victims, and it is something, it is part of them, this structure that we are building to ensure accountability for these attacks.  So the very first thing is to remember and honor the victims, and to use the information that is provided in this report.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, the second thing I would note is that the OPCW, where all of the countries that are members of the Partnership against Impunity are also members of the OPCW, and the Conference of States Parties in 2021 condemned Syria’s use of chemical weapons and suspended certain rights and privileges by an overwhelming vote of 87 to 15.  So with 102 countries present, 87 voted to condemn the actions of the Syrian regime and to hold them accountable by suspending some of their rights and privileges under the OPCW.  And we can certainly continue to work within the OPCW, and the partnership, I’m sure, will be active within the OPCW to continue to bring consequences to bear on the Syrian regime.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, a third thing is that the United States and many nations, including many nations that are members of the partnership, impose sanctions and travel restrictions on individuals and entities that are part of Syria’s CW program.  The United States and the partnership also supports the UN’s International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism that works diligently to document and build case files on violations of international humanitarian law, human rights, and other abuses that have taken place in Syria, including the use of chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And of course, and I think the point of this whole (inaudible) to wrap it up, is that there is a coalition of international organizations – which include the Partnership against Impunity, the OPCW, members of the Security Council and the General Assembly, and of course the United States – that coordinate their actions to help hold the Syrian regime accountable.  And in this regard, I would also draw your attention to a statement made yesterday by eight members of the Security Council also along these lines.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I hope that answers your question.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  We’ll now go to a question in our chat from Aya Sayed from Roayah News Network in Egypt.  And the first question is:  “Why did it take so long to prove that the Assad regime was behind the chemical attack in Douma?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, well, that’s a good question.  And the bottom line here of course is that the IIT is a highly professional but a small team.  This is the third report that the IIT has produced since 2019.  They published their first report in 2020, their second report in 2021.  The dedicated professionals in this team have carried out their work despite a global pandemic, and despite the refusal of the Assad regime to cooperate with them.  And despite these obstacles, they have produced a detailed and thorough report.  And I believe if you take a look at the report, they note that they have looked at 19,000 files, have witness statements of 66 witnesses, and have examined 70 chemical samples.  It’s a very extensive report, it’s a very professional job, and I would say it was worth the wait.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you for that.  We’d now like to go to one of our callers, Nadia Bilbassy from Al Arabiya TV.  Nadia, your line is open and you can go ahead and ask your question.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you so much for taking my question.  My apology, I joined later, so I wasn’t quite sure if this was asked.  But regardless, do you see the recent rehabilitation of the Syrian regime, the re-establishing of diplomatic relation might make it easier for Assad to escape accountability and whitewash his use of chemical weapons?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Well, as I said before, of course it is the policy of the United States that we will not normalize relations with the Assad regime and we don’t support others doing so until there is irreversible progress toward a political resolution.  It is also very firmly our policy and that of the vast majority of countries that are in the OPCW that one should hold those that use chemical weapons accountable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This report in and of itself does not address all of the issues that you need to address in the context of holding regime members accountable, but it is part of a bigger structure.  It is part of evidence gathering and building the confidence of the international community in its conclusions.  And I think that it will eventually lead to more accountability.  I might note that in a number of countries there have been criminal prosecutions and we might very well see more of those.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And with that, let’s go back to our questions from the chat.  Going back to Aya Sayed from Roayah News Network, who has the question:  “Does the chemical signature of the attack prove the source of the chemical agent used?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, thank you for that.  That is a good question.  And in fact, the IIT conducted a detailed and thorough analysis of the chemical signatures and brought in independent experts who worked separately to examine the data.  And they conclusively demonstrate that the chlorine present at the attack site was not environmental and that the signatures identified could only be explained by the release of high concentrations of toxic chlorine from cylinders.  This detailed analysis in fact provides a scientific basis to rule out those claims that somehow the attack was staged or that no chemical weapons attack occurred at all.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And then just with a follow-up on that from Aya Sayed:  “Was Russia involved in the attack?  And how could you make sure that those weapons were not in the hands of rebels or other actors other than the Syrian regime?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Well, let’s take a look at both of those questions.  I think what the IIT report tells you is that the Russian forces were collocated at the Douma Air Base alongside the Tiger Forces in the timeframe when the attack occurred and that the airspace over Douma was exclusively controlled by the Syrian Arab Air Force and the Russian Aero Defense Forces.  And subsequent to the attack, Russia has actively and consistently worked to try to shield the Assad regime from accountability for its chemical weapons use.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So I would say that at the very minimum, by extension Russia bears responsibility for these atrocities for shielding the Assad regime.  And I would add that after the incident, Russian military police helped the Syrian regime obstruct OPCW inspectors from gaining access to the site and did attempt to clean up and sanitize the site.  So I would say that we would very much call on the Russian Federation to stop these actions of shielding the Assad regime and to help us call to account those that use chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In terms of the question how do we ensure these weapons were not in the hands of rebels, the IIT did consider a possible range of scenarios and carefully tested their validity against the evidence that was gathered.  And the facts are very clear: the cylinders were dropped from a helicopter and the Syrian Air Force was the – at that time the only ones operating helicopters in that area.  The Syrian regime were the only party that had the motives to carry out this attack.  They were in fact launching an offensive to try to take control of this suburb of Damascus.  The airspace over Douma was controlled exclusively by the Syrian and Russian air forces.  And of course the last point that the chemical attack in Douma is not an isolated incident.  It’s part of a long history of Syria using chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But what I do want to underline here is the very logical and rigorous approach taken by the IIT.  They did not start with one scenario.  They started with a number of scenarios.  They tested the evidence against them.  They found no evidence for the alternate – to corroborate the alternate scenarios, like this was done by rebels or other actors.  And they did find evidence that would corroborate the conclusion that this attack was carried out by the Syrian Arab Air Force from one of their helicopters.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much for that, sir.  I’d like to turn it over now to one of our callers to ask a question live.  Michel Ghandour from MBN, you can go ahead and ask your question.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Good morning.  Thank you for doing this.  My question is the UN Security Council states called on Syria regime to remove any obstacles and to cooperate fully with the OPCW and fulfill its international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Syria didn’t comply in the past with the UN.  What if it does not comply this time, too?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And second, will the earthquakes affect the U.S. policy towards the Syrian regime?  Thank you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Well, let me take the earthquake issue first.  The United States of course is supporting a number of humanitarian agencies that are providing relief from the earthquakes, but I cannot go into that further because it’s not my area of expertise so I would refer you to the State Department on the question of earthquake relief.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the question, of course, of Syrian noncompliance, you know at the end of the day diplomacy is more a marathon and less a sprint, so we have to be willing to work on things on a medium and long term.  And the United States and the international community are determined that the Assad regime should be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons.  I outlined a number of places where we could do that work, including the United Nations, the OPCW, the Partnership against Impunity.  We’re also supporting humanitarian and NGO groups that collect information and evidence, and these brave Syrians and international organizations are risking their lives to document regime abuses and to collect evidence.  This is an ongoing process and we will not get tired of it.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  I believe we have time for one or two more questions.  I’d like to turn over to the last question submitted by Aya Sayed about measures to be taken in the future.  So the question is:  “Will there be any measures taken against the Assad regime?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Well, this does indeed go to the question that we’ve discussed before, which is how do you hold someone accountable.  And I do think that in different fora, in the Partnership against Impunity, in the OPCW and its Conference of States Parties, at the United Nations there will be continuing efforts to take the valuable information provided by this report and use it to hold the Assad regime liable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to these efforts at political accountability, of course there have been in some countries criminal prosecutions, and I expect that this will continue.  So I can sum up by saying I think the United States is going to continue to press for accountability and it is very much our goal to drive the use of chemical weapons down to zero.  And we will work with other responsible nations and organizations to hold the Assad regime to account.  And the end goal here would be that the Assad regime must fully declare and destroy its chemical weapons program and meet its international obligations.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much for that.  I see that we have a follow-up question from Nadia Bilbassy from Al Arabiya TV.  Nadia, would you like to ask your question?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Sorry, yes, I was unmuting myself.  I was going to follow up to my previous question about the role of Russia.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Oops, Nadia, I believe that you have muted yourself.  Can you unmute yourself? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Can you hear me now?  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes, we can.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, great.  I wanted to follow up on the role of Russia at the UN Security Council, particularly on the Assad regime.  I think the ambassador alluded to that and the international responsibility, but often we see that Russia is using veto to protect the Assad regime.  How significant do you think, as we go forward, this will be a significant factor maybe in the future considering what’s happening now?  I know it’s not related to the earthquake, but there is sympathy, et cetera, that actually it will be a cover by the Russians for the Syrian regime in particular.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, I’m not – sorry, I didn’t hear all of it quite clearly.  I mean, my understanding is your question is about do we expect Russia will continue to shield the Assad regime.  Is that the question?  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Correct.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Yes, unfortunately, there is a history here where Russia has had a long relationship with the Assad regime, was clearly physically in the area when they conducted these attacks, and from the very beginning has worked to obstruct the OPCW and the international community from trying to establish the facts.  I think one of the important things about this report is it very clearly demonstrates that the alternate Russian narrative simply has no basis in the evidence.  There are no facts to support the Russian alternate narrative.  On the contrary, there are ample facts to support the conclusion that it was the Syrian regime that conducted this attack.  And I think we should use this report and the facts that they lay out to make the case to the international community and to the Russian Federation that the international community should hold the Assad regime accountable and that the Russian Federation should stop shielding them.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Unfortunately, that’s all the time that we have for today.  I would like to thank all of our journalists for their questions, and thank you, Ambassador Manso, for joining us.  Before we close the call, I’d like to see if the ambassador has any final remarks for the group.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  I would just very briefly note that I would encourage all of you to actually look at the report.  It is a very detailed document, and it shows how the team meticulously went through the existing evidence and used what is a very reliable means in terms of investigation of never relying on one type of evidence only to reach a conclusion, but to have various types of evidence whether it’s open-source, photographs, chemical samples, scientific analysis, or physical evidence that they corroborate each other and that when you have (inaudible) telling you that this is how something happened, that is the best way to reach a reasonable conclusion.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So it’s an impressive piece of work, and I would urge you not just to listen to me but to take a look at the report.  And with that, thank you all very much.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And thank you, Ambassador.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">This call is strictly to discuss the OPCW IIT report on the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons in Douma in April 2018.  Ambassador Manso is the U.S. Representative to the OPCW, and he will only take questions during this briefing related to the Douma report.  This briefing is on the record and will be conducted in English with simultaneously Arabic interpretation.  To listen to the call in Arabic, select the Arabic audio channel at the bottom of your screen by clicking the globe icon.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’ll try to get to as many questions as possible in the 30 minutes we have today, so please show your support and like the questions you’d most like us to cover.  You can notify us of any technical difficulties at TheBrusselsHub@state.gov.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And with that, let’s get started.  Ambassador Manso, thank you so much for joining us today.  I’ll turn it over to you for opening remarks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you, Andrea, and thanks to everyone.  Good afternoon and thanks for attending this briefing.  First, I’d like to express my deep condolences for the tragic loss of life in both Türkiye and Syria due to this week’s devastating earthquakes.  It is not lost on us that many of the first responders in Syria now pulling civilians from the rubble were just a few years ago helping civilians who had been burned or suffocated by the Assad regime’s chemical weapons.  The humanity and bravery of these Syrian first responders is astonishing.  We salute them.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Earlier this month, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  It is regrettable that we must continue to express condemnation of the use of chemical weapons.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On January 27, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Investigation and Identification Team – the IIT – released its third report attributing the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and that’s the subject of our discussion today.  The OPCW director-general briefed this report to OPCW delegations last Thursday, February 2nd; and yesterday, February 7th, he briefed the UN Security Council in New York.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The IIT found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Forces dropped two cylinders containing toxic chlorine gas on the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7, 2018.  These weapons hit two residential buildings in a central area of that city, releasing the toxic chemical and killing 43 individuals and affecting countless more.  The report also mentions that the ITT received information that Russian forces were </span><span data-contrast="auto">collocated</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at the Douma Air Base alongside the Tiger Forces at the time of the incident and that the airspace over Douma was exclusively controlled by the Syrian Arab Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defense Forces.  The report clearly refutes Russia’s claim that this was an attack carried out by opposition forces and underscores the lack of cooperation from Russia and Syria to provide information on this attack.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This is the fifth separate instance of chemical weapons use that OPCW Investigation and Identification Team has attributed to the Assad regime.  This is in addition to four previous chemical </span><span data-contrast="auto">weapons attacks (inaudible)</span><span data-contrast="auto"> OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism, the JIM, attributed to the Assad regime.  Therefore, the chemical weapons attack in Douma is not an isolated incident.  The Syrian regime has a clear history of using chemical weapons, even after declaring it had given up its chemical weapons program.  The Assad regime’s blatant violations are an affront to the Chemical Weapons Convention and to basic human rights.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The international community must and will continue to work together at both the OPCW and the United Nations to hold the Assad regime to account for its use of chemical weapons against its own population.  Doing so will help restore deterrence against the use of chemical weapons and change the calculus of any state tempted to use chemical weapons in the future.  There must be no impunity for the use of chemical weapons.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you to all of you for being here, and with that, I am happy to take questions.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Thank you very much.  We’ll now turn to the question and answer portion of today’s briefing.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our first question comes from Camille Tawil from Asharq Al-Awsat in the United Kingdom.  And Camille asks, “In light of the chemical weapons use report, what is your message to the nations that are trying to establish links with the regime?  Türkiye and some Arab states seem to be ignoring your objection to dealing with Assad.  What would you say to them?”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:  </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Well, thank you for that question.  I think our policy is clear.  The U.S. administration will say that we will not normalize relations with the Assad regime.  We do not support others normalizing relations until there is irreversible progress toward a political resolution to the conflict, in line with Security Council Resolution 2254.  We have not seen that progress to date.  In addition, of course it is U.S. policy to hold accountable those who use chemical weapons, and this is a continuing effort with regard to the Assad regime in Syria and very much continues to be part of U.S. policy.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  We’ll now turn to one of our live questions.  We’d like to open a line for Ahmad Zakaria, please.  Ahmad, you can now ask your question.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Hi.  (Inaudible) Al Arabiya.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes, go ahead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  (In Arabic.)</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Oh, Ahmad, I’m sorry to – so we can only take the question in English, so let me go ahead and ask his question:  “The United States is also a member of the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, which was formed in 2018 and includes 40 countries and the European Union.  What are the options open to this international group to act in the event that the Security Council is unable to impose measures under chapter or clause?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, thank you for that question.  We are indeed members of the International Partnership against Impunity.  I would say here this is part of a – I think a broader issue of what can we do, what can the Partnership against Impunity do, and what can others do to hold the Assad regime accountable?  And this is an important question because often in multilateral diplomacy, our efforts to hold someone accountable and to accomplish something, it’s not just an event; it’s a process.  And I would say there are a number of things that we can do to hold the Assad regime accountable.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And the first thing I would say – and this is certainly also something that the international partnership could do – is to remember and honor the victims.  This report enters into history the research and the evidence that establishes these terrible acts.  It brings to light for the entire international community the truth of what happened to these victims, and it is something, it is part of them, this structure that we are building to ensure accountability for these attacks.  So the very first thing is to remember and honor the victims, and to use the information that is provided in this report.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, the second thing I would note is that the OPCW, where all of the countries that are members of the Partnership against Impunity are also members of the OPCW, and the Conference of States Parties in 2021 condemned Syria’s use of chemical weapons and suspended certain rights and privileges by an overwhelming vote of 87 to 15.  So with 102 countries present, 87 voted to condemn the actions of the Syrian regime and to hold them accountable by suspending some of their rights and privileges under the OPCW.  And we can certainly continue to work within the OPCW, and the partnership, I’m sure, will be active within the OPCW to continue to bring consequences to bear on the Syrian regime.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Of course, a third thing is that the United States and many nations, including many nations that are members of the partnership, impose sanctions and travel restrictions on individuals and entities that are part of Syria’s CW program.  The United States and the partnership also supports the UN’s International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism that works diligently to document and build case files on violations of international humanitarian law, human rights, and other abuses that have taken place in Syria, including the use of chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And of course, and I think the point of this whole (inaudible) to wrap it up, is that there is a coalition of international organizations – which include the Partnership against Impunity, the OPCW, members of the Security Council and the General Assembly, and of course the United States – that coordinate their actions to help hold the Syrian regime accountable.  And in this regard, I would also draw your attention to a statement made yesterday by eight members of the Security Council also along these lines.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I hope that answers your question.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  We’ll now go to a question in our chat from Aya Sayed from Roayah News Network in Egypt.  And the first question is:  “Why did it take so long to prove that the Assad regime was behind the chemical attack in Douma?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, well, that’s a good question.  And the bottom line here of course is that the IIT is a highly professional but a small team.  This is the third report that the IIT has produced since 2019.  They published their first report in 2020, their second report in 2021.  The dedicated professionals in this team have carried out their work despite a global pandemic, and despite the refusal of the Assad regime to cooperate with them.  And despite these obstacles, they have produced a detailed and thorough report.  And I believe if you take a look at the report, they note that they have looked at 19,000 files, have witness statements of 66 witnesses, and have examined 70 chemical samples.  It’s a very extensive report, it’s a very professional job, and I would say it was worth the wait.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you for that.  We’d now like to go to one of our callers, Nadia Bilbassy from Al Arabiya TV.  Nadia, your line is open and you can go ahead and ask your question.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you so much for taking my question.  My apology, I joined later, so I wasn’t quite sure if this was asked.  But regardless, do you see the recent rehabilitation of the Syrian regime, the re-establishing of diplomatic relation might make it easier for Assad to escape accountability and whitewash his use of chemical weapons?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Well, as I said before, of course it is the policy of the United States that we will not normalize relations with the Assad regime and we don’t support others doing so until there is irreversible progress toward a political resolution.  It is also very firmly our policy and that of the vast majority of countries that are in the OPCW that one should hold those that use chemical weapons accountable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This report in and of itself does not address all of the issues that you need to address in the context of holding regime members accountable, but it is part of a bigger structure.  It is part of evidence gathering and building the confidence of the international community in its conclusions.  And I think that it will eventually lead to more accountability.  I might note that in a number of countries there have been criminal prosecutions and we might very well see more of those.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And with that, let’s go back to our questions from the chat.  Going back to Aya Sayed from Roayah News Network, who has the question:  “Does the chemical signature of the attack prove the source of the chemical agent used?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, thank you for that.  That is a good question.  And in fact, the IIT conducted a detailed and thorough analysis of the chemical signatures and brought in independent experts who worked separately to examine the data.  And they conclusively demonstrate that the chlorine present at the attack site was not environmental and that the signatures identified could only be explained by the release of high concentrations of toxic chlorine from cylinders.  This detailed analysis in fact provides a scientific basis to rule out those claims that somehow the attack was staged or that no chemical weapons attack occurred at all.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And then just with a follow-up on that from Aya Sayed:  “Was Russia involved in the attack?  And how could you make sure that those weapons were not in the hands of rebels or other actors other than the Syrian regime?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Well, let’s take a look at both of those questions.  I think what the IIT report tells you is that the Russian forces were collocated at the Douma Air Base alongside the Tiger Forces in the timeframe when the attack occurred and that the airspace over Douma was exclusively controlled by the Syrian Arab Air Force and the Russian Aero Defense Forces.  And subsequent to the attack, Russia has actively and consistently worked to try to shield the Assad regime from accountability for its chemical weapons use.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So I would say that at the very minimum, by extension Russia bears responsibility for these atrocities for shielding the Assad regime.  And I would add that after the incident, Russian military police helped the Syrian regime obstruct OPCW inspectors from gaining access to the site and did attempt to clean up and sanitize the site.  So I would say that we would very much call on the Russian Federation to stop these actions of shielding the Assad regime and to help us call to account those that use chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In terms of the question how do we ensure these weapons were not in the hands of rebels, the IIT did consider a possible range of scenarios and carefully tested their validity against the evidence that was gathered.  And the facts are very clear: the cylinders were dropped from a helicopter and the Syrian Air Force was the – at that time the only ones operating helicopters in that area.  The Syrian regime were the only party that had the motives to carry out this attack.  They were in fact launching an offensive to try to take control of this suburb of Damascus.  The airspace over Douma was controlled exclusively by the Syrian and Russian air forces.  And of course the last point that the chemical attack in Douma is not an isolated incident.  It’s part of a long history of Syria using chemical weapons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">But what I do want to underline here is the very logical and rigorous approach taken by the IIT.  They did not start with one scenario.  They started with a number of scenarios.  They tested the evidence against them.  They found no evidence for the alternate – to corroborate the alternate scenarios, like this was done by rebels or other actors.  And they did find evidence that would corroborate the conclusion that this attack was carried out by the Syrian Arab Air Force from one of their helicopters.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much for that, sir.  I’d like to turn it over now to one of our callers to ask a question live.  Michel Ghandour from MBN, you can go ahead and ask your question.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Good morning.  Thank you for doing this.  My question is the UN Security Council states called on Syria regime to remove any obstacles and to cooperate fully with the OPCW and fulfill its international obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Syria didn’t comply in the past with the UN.  What if it does not comply this time, too?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And second, will the earthquakes affect the U.S. policy towards the Syrian regime?  Thank you.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Well, let me take the earthquake issue first.  The United States of course is supporting a number of humanitarian agencies that are providing relief from the earthquakes, but I cannot go into that further because it’s not my area of expertise so I would refer you to the State Department on the question of earthquake relief.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On the question, of course, of Syrian noncompliance, you know at the end of the day diplomacy is more a marathon and less a sprint, so we have to be willing to work on things on a medium and long term.  And the United States and the international community are determined that the Assad regime should be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons.  I outlined a number of places where we could do that work, including the United Nations, the OPCW, the Partnership against Impunity.  We’re also supporting humanitarian and NGO groups that collect information and evidence, and these brave Syrians and international organizations are risking their lives to document regime abuses and to collect evidence.  This is an ongoing process and we will not get tired of it.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much.  I believe we have time for one or two more questions.  I’d like to turn over to the last question submitted by Aya Sayed about measures to be taken in the future.  So the question is:  “Will there be any measures taken against the Assad regime?”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Well, this does indeed go to the question that we’ve discussed before, which is how do you hold someone accountable.  And I do think that in different fora, in the Partnership against Impunity, in the OPCW and its Conference of States Parties, at the United Nations there will be continuing efforts to take the valuable information provided by this report and use it to hold the Assad regime liable.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In addition to these efforts at political accountability, of course there have been in some countries criminal prosecutions, and I expect that this will continue.  So I can sum up by saying I think the United States is going to continue to press for accountability and it is very much our goal to drive the use of chemical weapons down to zero.  And we will work with other responsible nations and organizations to hold the Assad regime to account.  And the end goal here would be that the Assad regime must fully declare and destroy its chemical weapons program and meet its international obligations.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Thank you very much for that.  I see that we have a follow-up question from Nadia Bilbassy from Al Arabiya TV.  Nadia, would you like to ask your question?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Sorry, yes, I was unmuting myself.  I was going to follow up to my previous question about the role of Russia.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Oops, Nadia, I believe that you have muted yourself.  Can you unmute yourself? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Can you hear me now?  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes, we can.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, great.  I wanted to follow up on the role of Russia at the UN Security Council, particularly on the Assad regime.  I think the ambassador alluded to that and the international responsibility, but often we see that Russia is using veto to protect the Assad regime.  How significant do you think, as we go forward, this will be a significant factor maybe in the future considering what’s happening now?  I know it’s not related to the earthquake, but there is sympathy, et cetera, that actually it will be a cover by the Russians for the Syrian regime in particular.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay, I’m not – sorry, I didn’t hear all of it quite clearly.  I mean, my understanding is your question is about do we expect Russia will continue to shield the Assad regime.  Is that the question?  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">QUESTION:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Correct.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Yes. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Okay.  Yes, unfortunately, there is a history here where Russia has had a long relationship with the Assad regime, was clearly physically in the area when they conducted these attacks, and from the very beginning has worked to obstruct the OPCW and the international community from trying to establish the facts.  I think one of the important things about this report is it very clearly demonstrates that the alternate Russian narrative simply has no basis in the evidence.  There are no facts to support the Russian alternate narrative.  On the contrary, there are ample facts to support the conclusion that it was the Syrian regime that conducted this attack.  And I think we should use this report and the facts that they lay out to make the case to the international community and to the Russian Federation that the international community should hold the Assad regime accountable and that the Russian Federation should stop shielding them.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  Unfortunately, that’s all the time that we have for today.  I would like to thank all of our journalists for their questions, and thank you, Ambassador Manso, for joining us.  Before we close the call, I’d like to see if the ambassador has any final remarks for the group.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">AMBASSADOR MANSO:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  I would just very briefly note that I would encourage all of you to actually look at the report.  It is a very detailed document, and it shows how the team meticulously went through the existing evidence and used what is a very reliable means in terms of investigation of never relying on one type of evidence only to reach a conclusion, but to have various types of evidence whether it’s open-source, photographs, chemical samples, scientific analysis, or physical evidence that they corroborate each other and that when you have (inaudible) telling you that this is how something happened, that is the best way to reach a reasonable conclusion.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">So it’s an impressive piece of work, and I would urge you not just to listen to me but to take a look at the report.  And with that, thank you all very much.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">MODERATOR:</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">  And thank you, Ambassador.  Shortly we’ll send the audio recording of the briefing to all participating journalists and we’ll provide a transcript as soon as it’s available.  We’d also love to hear your feedback, and you can contact us at any time at TheBrusselsHub@state.gov.  Thanks again for your participation and we hope you can join us for another press briefing soon.  This ends today’s briefing.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
