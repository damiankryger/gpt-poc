  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/24/president-biden-to-kick-off-investing-in-america-tour-in-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Investing in America tour&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information Alan Davidson traveled to Hickory, NC to celebrate the announcement of new fiber optic cable production in the U.S. made possible by the Administration’s Internet for All Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law requires the use of Made-in-America materials and products for federally funded infrastructure projects including high-speed Internet deployment in America. As a result, two key manufacturers near Hickory, North Carolina announced new investments and partnerships today. &lt;strong&gt;CommScope and Corning are investing a combined nearly $550 million and creating hundreds of new jobs in America to build the fiber optic cables that will help close the digital divide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement builds on the work the Biden-Harris Administration has already done to bring affordable, high-speed Internet to nearly 17 million American households since the President took office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a tremendous opportunity not just to close the digital divide for millions of Americans, but also to revitalize domestic manufacturing industry, make more products and technologies in America, and create good manufacturing jobs here in Hickory and across the country,” &lt;strong&gt;said Secretary Raimondo&lt;/strong&gt;. “President Biden has been clear that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is an opportunity to invest in America. With today’s announcements, that investment continues by producing the fiber we’re going to use to get everyone connected to the Internet right here in America with products made in America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;strong&gt;CommScope&lt;/strong&gt; announced an additional $47 million investment towards expanding its U.S. fiber optic cable manufacturing, including its facility in Catawba, which is already the largest hybrid-fiber-coaxial facility for broadband networks in the world. According to CommScope, this facility will produce a new rural fiber optic cable that is specifically designed for rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corning&lt;/strong&gt; announced the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing capacity with the opening of its manufacturing campus near Hickory today. It builds on the more than $500 million that Corning has invested in fiber and cable manufacturing since 2020. The company has also formed a partnership with NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association - to dedicate a portion of the cable manufactured at its facility to small, rural providers and co-ops that will connect Americans across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been talking about the digital divide in this country for decades. Now, thanks to President Biden’s Internet for All initiative, we finally have the resources to do something serious about it,” &lt;strong&gt;said Alan Davidson, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and NTIA Administrator&lt;/strong&gt;. “CommScope and Corning’s announcements today will help ensure we have the fiber we need to build affordable, reliable high-speed Internet networks. Our focus at NTIA is on deploying these networks, and investing in American jobs and manufacturing in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Biden-Harris administration’s $65 billion Internet for All&lt;/strong&gt; initiative will help close this digital divide across the country. Currently, 24 million U.S. households lack Internet access. NTIA is working to address this through $48 billion in grant programs to expand high-speed Internet access by funding planning, infrastructure deployment and adoption programs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden-Harris Administration is investing a historic $65 billion to bring affordable, reliable high-speed Internet service to everyone in America. But this Internet for All initiative is not just going to get Americans online — it's going to create good-paying manufacturing jobs and revitalize the domestic broadband manufacturing industry.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Biden said in his State of the Union address, “We’re making sure that every community — every community in America has access to affordable, high-speed Internet… I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. Made in America. I mean it. Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law requires the use of Made-in-America materials and products for federally funded infrastructure projects including high-speed Internet deployment in America. As a result, today, two key manufacturers near Hickory, North Carolina announced new investments and partnerships.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CommScope and Corning are investing a combined nearly $550 million and creating hundreds of new jobs in America to build the fiber optic cables that will help close the digital divide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CommScope,&lt;/strong&gt; a provider of broadband network equipment, announced an additional $47 million investment towards expanding its U.S. fiber optic cable manufacturing, including its facility in Catawba. That facility is already the largest hybrid-fiber-coaxial facility for broadband networks in the world and employs more than 500 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CommScope, this investment will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create more than 250 new jobs over next five years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Produce new fiber optic cable that is specifically designed for rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide ability to service to more than 500,000 homes per year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Invest $47 million in the U.S. toward expanding fiber optic cable production focused on rural applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corning,&lt;/strong&gt; a producer of optical fiber and cable, announced the expansion of its U.S. manufacturing capacity with the opening of its manufacturing campus near Hickory today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Corning, this new investment will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add hundreds of manufacturing jobs to Corning’s more than 5,000 employees in the state.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continue progress on a series of investments totaling more than $500 million since 2020 to help build fiber in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Corning has partnered with NTCA — The Rural Broadband Association — to dedicate a portion of the cable manufactured at its facility to small, rural providers and co-ops that will connect Americans across the country. This will help smaller Internet Service Providers participate in federally funded programs with Buy America requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Biden-Harris Administration’s $65 billion Internet for All &lt;/strong&gt;initiative will help close the digital divide across the country. Currently, 24 million U.S. households lack Internet access. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is working to address this through $48 billion in grant programs to expand high-speed Internet access by funding planning, infrastructure deployment and adoption programs across the country. As part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Investing in America agenda, nearly 17 million American households now have access to affordable, high-speed Internet, saving each $30-$75 per month. For more on NTIA’s work to bring high-speed Internet to everyone in America, see &lt;a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy America &lt;/strong&gt;requirements are a major part of ensuring we maximize the economic potential of the Internet for All initiative by manufacturing the materials needed right here in America. Manufacturing the iron, steel, fiber, and construction materials needed to deliver affordable, reliable, high-speed Internet service to millions of Americans is an opportunity to create jobs right here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NTIA believes that if it &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be Made in America, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be made in America – and it will faithfully implement the ‘Build America, Buy America’ requirements outlined in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This announcement is part of President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes the historic investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan. Together, these investments are unleashing a manufacturing boom, helping rebuild our infrastructure and bring back supply chains, lowering costs for hardworking families, and creating jobs that don’t require a four-year degree across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economy has created more than 12 million jobs since President Biden took office – including 800,000 manufacturing jobs – and has recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic and more. The private sector has already invested more than $435 billion in new manufacturing here in America, including multi-billion-dollar semiconductor factories, electric battery manufacturers, broadband manufacturers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Thank you, John, for that introduction and thank you to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for hosting this forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;I also want to thank the private sector leaders that are here today. You play a vital role in countering democratic backsliding and ensuring that democracies deliver for their people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;As President Biden has said, “democracy does not happen by accident…democracy needs champions.” From my conversations with the private sector and from the commitments and successes we will hear about in this forum, I know businesses large and small are standing up and being counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And there is good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Throughout our history, and especially since the end of World War II, we have recognized that the foundations of a prosperous, inclusive, and stable world economic order are democratic societies that value the rule of law, fundamental freedoms, human and labor rights, fair and mutually beneficial trade, and innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We know from our history in the U.S. that when we have adhered to these highest ideals, our private sector has flourished, creating unprecedented economic opportunities for the middle class and for those seeking to enter the middle class. &lt;em&gt;Put simply, democracy creates conditions for private sector growth, and a flourishing private sector in turn ensures that democracy delivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And yet, today we are at a critical moment. Whether it is China’s misuse of critical technologies or Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, authoritarian regimes are evermore adversarial, taking actions that serve to undermine the rules-based order that we, as democracies, have been building for decades. We are at a critical juncture  – how we as governments and the private sector in democratic societies respond will have a profound impact on the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Will we work together to secure the benefits of democracy not only for this generation but future generations? That is the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;That’s why the Biden-Harris Administration’s call to action to the private sector and this forum on Business and Democracy are so timely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;This morning, I’d like to discuss why the role of business in advancing democracy is so important, and what the Commerce Department is doing with U.S. business in four critical areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class="RemarksNumberedList"&gt;Winning the high-stakes tech competition with authoritarian adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="RemarksNumberedList"&gt;Advancing the global fight against corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="RemarksNumberedList"&gt;Promoting labor and environmental standards and human rights in the conduct of business.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="RemarksNumberedList"&gt;Protecting the civic space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winning the High-Stakes Tech Competition with Authoritarian Adversaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;First, on the high-stakes tech competition with authoritarian adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Authoritarian regimes are accelerating their efforts to expropriate critical technologies, including for military modernization, mass surveillance, and other human rights abuses. Their efforts to control supply chains – including clean energy supply chains and others – can create choke points that will jeopardize the ability of democracies to deploy vital technologies to further their development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Look no further than China, which, for example, is using supercomputing capabilities and AI models to monitor, track, and surveil their own citizens. And as has been widely reported, they are also harnessing biotech to build a massive DNA database to help fuel their surveillance state and repress members of ethnic and religious minority groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;This technological advantage, along with economic coercion, means that they can undermine the sovereignty of other countries, including their ability to develop freely. We have seen this in countries from Eastern Europe to the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;How this global tech competition plays out will profoundly shape our economic security – our ability to innovate, grow exports, create jobs of the future, and provide opportunities to all our people. It will also impact our national security .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;It is vital that free and democratic societies prevail if the future world order is to be based on norms like the free flow of information, data privacy, and an open internet, rather than the alternative, democratic backsliding, the subversion of markets by state actors, and fewer opportunities for private sector innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;This is why the Commerce Department is taking action on three fronts, along with  like-minded allies, to ensure that their private sectors help democracies deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;First, under the Biden Administration, we have broken new ground in our &lt;strong&gt;partnerships on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;export controls &lt;/strong&gt;to prevent, for example, Russia’s use of technologies to enhance its military and defense sectors as part of the U.S. Government’s and its allies’  response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and in other contexts to address the deployment of technologies to advance antidemocratic agendas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;For instance, at the 2021 Summit for Democracy, the Administration announced the creation of the Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative collaboration with Australia, Denmark, and Norway and others. Through the Initiative, we are working to stem the misuse of technology and promote a positive vision for technologies anchored by democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Similarly, in October 2022, we took strong action to restrict access to AI-enabling technologies such as advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and other items to China. We have also vigorously used the Entity List and imposed other export control restrictions to prevent both foreign government and private sector entities from accessing commercial technologies that can be employed to abuse human rights. Private sector compliance ensures that these controls are successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Second, we are working to win the tech competition through the development of &lt;strong&gt;risk frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; that help the private sector anticipate and mitigate emerging threats that may surface in connection with key technologies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Earlier this year, the National Institute of Standards and Technology – or NIST – released its AI Risk Management Framework, a voluntary framework to advance more trustworthy and responsible development and use of AI, while managing risks based on our democratic values. The framework helps accelerate AI innovation and growth while protecting against its misuse against civil rights, civil liberties, and equity. We also released, via the White House, a vision for harnessing biotechnology and biomanufacturing R&amp;D to build supply chain resilience – which includes ensuring that we consider biosafety and biosecurity risks from the start of development and use of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Third, we are &lt;strong&gt;investing to preserve our tech advantage &lt;/strong&gt;through industrial strategies at home that mobilize private sector investment, growth and jobs in critical technologies that will have an outsized impact on our economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, we are investing billions in our domestic semiconductor industry. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are deploying nearly $50 billion to bring affordable, reliable high-speed internet to every American. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Administration is making largest-ever federal investment in clean energy innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;At the same time, we are bolstering our investment screening capabilities through, for instance, our review of inbound investment in U.S. companies and operations under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to identify adversarial capital that leaves us vulnerable. We are working closely with the private sector to alert companies to the potential risks of transactions with malign actors. And we are considering outbound investment screening in areas where we may inadvertently further adversaries’ efforts to undermine our economic and national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Abroad, we are revitalizing economic alliances with partners and democracies around the world – in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Through bilateral engagements in countries as diverse as Mexico, Cote d’Ivoire, and India, as well as multilateral approaches like the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, or IPEF, Commerce is leading efforts to improve market conditions for exporters, ensuring acceptance of high product and labor standards, improving supply chain resilience, and driving progress on the clean energy transition and digital trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We are building on President Biden’s announcement of $15 billion in private sector deals at the US-Africa Business Forum in December and Vice President Harris’ announcements just this week. These deals are cementing business to business relationships across the Atlantic in ways that promote jobs and demonstrate how democracies, working together, can deliver for our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Global Fight Against Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Business is also an indispensable ally in the global fight against corruption, the second area I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;President Biden has called corruption “a cancer within the body of societies,” and his Administration has released the first-ever U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption. Corruption erodes trust in business and democratic institutions. It undermines economic growth, social equity, and democracy. And corruption distorts markets and prioritizes private gain over public interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Under the Strategy, we are working with governmental and non-governmental partners – including bolstering and promoting public-private partnerships – to more consistently bring in the private sector as critical actors in the fight against corruption, to help level the playing field for businesses operating with integrity, and to improve the international business climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Commerce Department supports a wide range of efforts to work with the business community to combat corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;In Africa, through our Commercial Law Development Program, we are working with the Nigerian Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission to develop and implement ethics and transparency standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt; In the Americas, we partnered with the private sector to establish the Inter-American Coalition for Business Ethics for the MedTech Sector. This is a code of ethics for the Western Hemisphere in a sector of export value for U.S. companies and is supported by ethics compliance training and a monitoring mechanism to track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And under the “Fair Economy” Pillar of IPEF, we are working with 13 partner countries across the Indo-Pacific to accelerate progress on implementation of international anticorruption obligations such as the UN Convention against Corruption, promote private sector ethics and compliance programs , and facilitate  input from the private sector – including business organizations, industry associations, and workers’ organizations – on progress on implementation of anti-corruption efforts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing Labor and Environment Standard and Human Rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The third area I mentioned was advancing labor and environmental standards and human rights. The private sector has a choice in how they conduct their business, how they innovate and produce, how they source inputs.  A work-centric, climate-smart approach and one that respects human rights reflects foresight – and is more likely to contribute to shared prosperity, reduce inequality and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;From my conversations with CEOs and small business owners across the United States, I know that many business leaders understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;That is why we collaborated with the private sector and the Department of Labor to publish a set of Principles for what constitutes good jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;In the industrial strategy programs we are implementing, we are asking companies to submit workforce development plans that align with these Good Jobs Principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We are also encouraging Project Labor Agreements, which are an essential tool in ensuring that constructions projects of this scale and complexity stay on track.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And because childcare is critical to expanding employment opportunity, we’re requiring companies that receive CHIPS funding to tell us how they plan to provide access to affordable childcare for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We are following a similar approach abroad in partner countries. For instance, the Partnership for Global Investment and Infrastructure, a G7 partnership, aims to leverage a total of $600 billion in public and mostly private infrastructure financing in emerging markets for projects in health security, clean energy transition, critical minerals, and the digital economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;These PGII projects aim to be inclusive, transparent, and supportive of high labor and environmental standards that enhance their sustainability and impact. Over the course of 12 roundtables with the private sector over the past year, the Commerce Department has heard time and again how U.S. businesses view these high standards projects as a key differentiator relative to our competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our partners in emerging markets in turn view the U.S. private sector as a partner of choice. Working together in this way, businesses with governments at home and aboard are ensuring that democracies deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And there’s more. The private sector is also a key ally on the frontlines of the fight for democracy. Following Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I was particularly proud to see the U.S. business community step up through the donation of funds and critical products, in-kind support to help the continued flow of commerce, and industry expertise and know-how to assist Ukraine in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting the Civic Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Finally, the private sector like other stakeholders in democratic societies has a responsibility to protect the civic space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;A healthy public square encourages debate, ensures access to information, and provides the enabling environment for free speech. Here too, the private sector’s role and its voice as a key stakeholder in civil society is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;That is why – on behalf of the United States – I was pleased to sign onto the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Declaration is political commitment led by the U.S., the European Commission, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom to defend the open internet, promote human rights online, and foster fair competition in the digital economy. We are working with multiple stakeholders, including the private sector, to implement and advance the principles laid out in the Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;From where I sit in the Commerce Department, I see the vital importance of the private sector’s voice – along with labor and other stakeholders, in rulemaking and policy formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We currently support 62 federal advisory committees across a wide array of topics. These committees are vital vehicles for transparent private sector engagement that – by design – bring in diverse voices to develop consensus recommendations on policy priorities. Membership is public, as are the committee meetings and their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Under the Biden Administration, we have made deliverable progress in ensuring that these committees are more diverse and inclusive than they have been, for instance, ensuring membership of labor unions as key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;I’ll close with this:  a prosperous business community and a flourishing democracy are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;But democracy, like business, is always a work in progress. It takes leadership, vision, and commitment to keep a business running, just as it takes those same qualities to advance the values of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The conditions for a free and open democracy enable businesses to thrive. Companies, therefore, have an incentive and a vital role to advance democratic norms, principles, and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;This forum is helping to deepen the vital partnerships among government, the private sector, and other stakeholders as we work together to strengthen democracy around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We in the government are working hard to set the stage, but we can’t do it alone. The actions of the business community are paramount to this effort. We need you to be champions of democracy. That’s why this forum is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We’re counting on you to continue your critical work to counter authoritarianism and democratic backsliding, combat corruption, and promote human rights. I know you’re up to the task, and we’re eager to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Thank you to CSIS for the opportunity to join you today. I look forward to continuing our partnership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p class="gdp"&gt;Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce is announcing the Regional Economic Research Initiative (Regional Initiative), a new data initiative to improve our nation’s understanding of local regional economies and their ability to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of place has often been overlooked in favor of other ways of studying and growing the economy, which has contributed to the concentration of economic opportunity on the coasts and in major cities. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vdHdpdHRlci5jb20vSmVkS29sa28vc3RhdHVzLzE2MTAyODk4NTUxMTk4OTI0ODE_cz0yMCIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjcuNzQxMDA1MDEifQ.IblZH02fttuGhwfs-HJW6GMQLOa4nDiJeUp5RRBfYfA/s/606887802/br/156921443654-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!5TtUhgON3TWR15ZCKn9is6StwkwsRyxcTp_ScuHJviUocyRZb5d41EtkK5Qvybqz-6v3VLeF2SufU3wB1CiA3IQnCZElrgqjsw$" rel="noreferrer"&gt;New analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the Department’s Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs shows this kind of geographic inequality across regions in the U.S. has increased over the last 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For too long, cities and towns across the country have been overlooked or left behind. Americans deserve to be able to work and thrive in their home communities,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “With the right partnerships and investments, every corner of America can flourish in the modern, global economy. The Regional Economic Research Initiative will use the power of data to identify and catalyze investments to spur economic opportunities across America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to bridging geographic gaps through transformative investments that will revitalize economic growth in lagging or distressed regions. The Department of Commerce has already dedicated billions of dollars towards increasing regional economic competitiveness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitive regional and local grant programs, such as the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkYS5nb3YvZnVuZGluZy9wcm9ncmFtcy9hbWVyaWNhbi1yZXNjdWUtcGxhbi9idWlsZC1iYWNrLWJldHRlciIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjcuNzQxMDA1MDEifQ.e_LvkRYFOzUvHQjZkCt1KROejXOAiBZpx_zN3uZT_F0/s/606887802/br/156921443654-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!5TtUhgON3TWR15ZCKn9is6StwkwsRyxcTp_ScuHJviUocyRZb5d41EtkK5Qvybqz-6v3VLeF2SufU3wB1CiA3IQnCZFRyeTDDQ$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Economic Development Administration’s Build Back Better Regional Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkYS5nb3YvZnVuZGluZy9wcm9ncmFtcy9yZWdpb25hbC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWh1YnMiLCJidWxsZXRpbl9pZCI6IjIwMjMwMzI3Ljc0MTAwNTAxIn0.Gp_yc1C3ppRUuKaRmDdA9LTbUSMSDzsuRArq_Cp8Bl4/s/606887802/br/156921443654-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!5TtUhgON3TWR15ZCKn9is6StwkwsRyxcTp_ScuHJviUocyRZb5d41EtkK5Qvybqz-6v3VLeF2SufU3wB1CiA3IQnCZFK7o6Bow$" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Tech Hubs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDQsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkYS5nb3YvYWJvdXQvY2FyZWVycy9yZWNvbXBldGUtcGlsb3QtcHJvZ3JhbSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjcuNzQxMDA1MDEifQ.xY5vazI1bOT6SOYO9EkelFZOLyilP-Uy8MKItE21iXA/s/606887802/br/156921443654-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!5TtUhgON3TWR15ZCKn9is6StwkwsRyxcTp_ScuHJviUocyRZb5d41EtkK5Qvybqz-6v3VLeF2SufU3wB1CiA3IQnCZHptR0tmw$" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Recompete Pilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Grants and cooperative agreements, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, dedicated to conservation, restoration, and protection of coastal and marine habitats to help to sustain resource dependent communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sustained change, grow, or revive a regional economy, investors must know what types of investments will work – and what won’t. The Regional Initiative will equip public and private sector decisionmakers at every level – local, state, Tribal, federal – with research and data tools to address entrenched and growing geographic inequality, and better meet the economic needs of those they serve. The Regional Initiative will help identify strengths and weaknesses of regional economies, uncover new opportunities for growth, provide insights into local economic needs, and maximize the impact of regional investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s great if people are able to move to places where there’s more economic opportunity – but many people face barriers that make moving difficult or impossible, so they need economic opportunities where they live now,” said Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs Jed Kolko. “Geographic inequality continues to widen, and high-paying sectors remain concentrated in specific places. The Regional Initiative will spotlight those key trends and ensure federal investments are coordinated to close these gaps and improve regional competitiveness.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by the Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs (OUSEA), the Regional Initiative will develop and disseminate research, accessible data tools and visualizations, and expert services to decisionmakers at every level. Specifically, OUSEA will harness the power of statistical and federal program data sets to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide deeper knowledge about regional economies, uncovering unique insights about regions and their needs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Show where past federal investments have been made in local economies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Help decisionmakers determine what types and levels of investment will maximize impact to regions, based on the place’s unique characteristics and what has worked before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department’s top economic advisors and data experts in OUSEA will lead the Regional Initiative and plan to release initial research and data products within the calendar year. OUSEA is charged with setting the data and evidence strategy for the Department and guiding critical economic analysis of the Department’s priorities. The bureau also provides policy direction and oversight to the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding Protections for Pacific Remote Islands Toward Goal of Conserving 30% of U.S. Ocean by 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following President Biden’s call to action at the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-takes-new-action-to-conserve-and-restore-americas-lands-and-waters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;White House Conservation in Action Summit&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/24/memorandum-on-conserving-the-natural-and-cultural-heritage-of-the-pacific-remote-islands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Presidential Memorandum&lt;/a&gt; issued today, the Commerce Department directed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to initiate a &lt;a href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/management/designations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; to consider designating all U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands as a national marine sanctuary. A sanctuary designation would provide additional layers of protection for the region’s important marine ecosystems, maritime heritage resources, and support the cultural heritage and values of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fulfilling our bold conservation goals are a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration and the Commerce Department,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Our National Marine Sanctuary System is critical to achieving these goals, as well as honoring the cultural heritage of coastal communities around the country. As President Biden noted, expanding protections for the Pacific Remote Islands would create the largest protected ocean area on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.protectpri.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Pacific Remote Islands Coalition&lt;/a&gt; nominated an area totaling about 770,000 square miles for sanctuary designation. That area includes the existing as well as the submerged lands and waters surrounding the existing Monument to the limit of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The Pacific Remote Islands encompass seven islands, atolls, and a reef unit: Baker, Howland, Jarvis, Johnston, Wake, Palmyra, and Kingman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable to climate change impacts, the atolls, shoals, seamounts, banks and reefs in this unique and fragile area are home to some of the most diverse and remarkable tropical marine life on the planet and provides haven for a host of species from corals and fish to marine mammals and seabirds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ecosystems and cultural resources of the Pacific Remote Islands are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. “The proposed sanctuary would also recognize the importance of Indigenous knowledge, stories, and cultural connections between lands and peoples, and celebrate distinct cultures.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctuary designation would allow NOAA to augment the existing protections for the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument with additional regulatory and non-regulatory tools, and to conserve additional areas beyond the Monument’s existing boundary. The sanctuary designation would not include any terrestrial areas or diminish the protections of the existing monument designations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the next 30 days, NOAA will issue a Notice of Intent (NOI) to begin the public scoping process to initiate designation of a national marine sanctuary in the Pacific Remote Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the President’s direction, the Commerce Department and the Department of the Interior will also conduct a public process to work with regional Indigenous cultural leaders to appropriately rename the existing Pacific Remote Islands National Monument, and potentially the Islands themselves, to honor the area’s heritage, ancestral pathways, and stopping points for Pacific Island voyagers, and to provide posthumous recognition for young Native Hawaiian men sent to secure U.S. territorial claim to the islands in the run up to World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title> HHS and DOC Announce Plan to Review March-In Authority </title>

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced efforts to pursue a whole-of-government approach to review its march-in authority as laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act, which promotes commercialization of research results, maximizes the potential for federally-funded technologies to become products, and serves the broader interest of the American public. The Interagency Working Group for Bayh-Dole will develop a framework for implementation of the march-in provision that clearly articulates guiding criteria and processes for making determinations where different factors, including price, may be a consideration in agencies’ assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to increasing access to health care and lowering costs. And march-in authority is a powerful tool designed to ensure that the benefits of the American taxpayer’s investment in research and development are reasonably accessible to the public,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We look forward to updates from the Bayh-Dole Interagency Working Group, and at my direction, HHS will review the findings, engage the public, and better define how HHS could effectively utilize our authority moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Bayh-Dole Act is a cornerstone of our innovation system in the U.S., which carefully balances the interests of the taxpayer, government, and the private sector. Maintaining that successful balance is critical as we work with HHS and other agencies to develop a framework and criteria for the use of the march-in provision,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bayh-Dole Act was designed to facilitate the commercialization of inventions developed with public funds, by granting the recipient of those funds the option to retain ownership and seek patents on those inventions. At the same time, the law provides the federal government with residual rights for inventions developed using federal dollars, including the authority to grant licenses to such inventions to third parties when the benefits of the invention are not available to the public on reasonable terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other agencies have been petitioned on several occasions to initiate march-in proceedings, but to date have not invoked this authority. Most recently, the NIH declined a petition to initiate a march-in proceeding for the prostate cancer drug Xtandi®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, DOC’s National Institute of Standards and Technology published the revised Bayh-Dole Act rule, “Rights to Federally Funded Inventions and Licensing of Government Owned Inventions,” that is intended to streamline and clarify procedures, apply technical corrections, and remove or correct outdated references that had accumulated in the regulations over time. These revisions were made in response to more than 80,000 comments received to a January 2021 notice of proposed rulemaking from a broad array of stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with President Biden’s Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, the DOC has not finalized any provisions on march-in rights in this revised rule that would have prohibited the government’s use of march-in solely on the basis of product pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS will convene a workshop in 2023 to further refine the cases for which HHS could consider exercising march-in authority. HHS will seek input from a diverse array of stakeholders – including patient groups, industry, universities, small business firms, and nonprofit organizations, as well as experts in technology transfer and innovation policy. The goal of the workshop will be to assess when the use of march-in is consistent with the policy and objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardrails Will Ensure Innovations and Technology Funded by CHIPS Act Bolsters Technological and National Security for America and Our Allies &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="gdp"&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce today released a &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-05869/preventing-the-improper-use-of-creating-helpful-incentives-to-produce-semiconductors-for-america-act" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&lt;/a&gt; for the guardrails included in the CHIPS Incentives Program to advance America’s technological and national security. The national security guardrails are intended to ensure technology and innovation funded by the CHIPS and Science Act is not used for malign purposes by adversarial countries against the United States or its allies and partners. The CHIPS and Science Act is part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda for unleashing a manufacturing and innovation boom, driving U.S. competitiveness and strengthening economic and national security. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule offers additional details on national security measures applicable to the CHIPS Incentives Program included in the CHIPS and Science Act, limiting recipients of funding from investing in the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in foreign countries of concern. The statute identifies those countries as the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These guardrails will advance shared national security interests as the U.S. continues coordinating and collaborating with allies and partners to make global supply chains more resilient and diversified.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The innovation and technology funded in the CHIPS Act is how we plan to expand the technological and national security advantages of America and our allies; these guardrails will help ensure we stay ahead of adversaries for decades to come,” said &lt;strong&gt;Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.&lt;/strong&gt; “CHIPS for America is fundamentally a national security initiative and these guardrails will help ensure malign actors do not have access to the cutting-edge technology that can be used against America and our allies. We will also continue coordinating with our allies and partners to ensure this program advances our shared goals, strengthens global supply chains, and enhances our collective security.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding provided by the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act included clear guardrails to strengthen national security: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The statute prohibits recipients of CHIPS incentives funds from using the funds in other countries. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The statute significantly restricts recipients of CHIPS incentives funds from investing in most semiconductor manufacturing in foreign countries of concern for 10 years after the date of award. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The statute limits recipients of CHIPS incentives funds from engaging in joint research or technology licensing efforts with a foreign entity of concern that relates to a technology or product that raises national security concerns.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s proposed rule outlines additional details on and definitions for these national security guardrails. The proposed rule will:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish Standards to Restrict Advanced Facility Expansion in Foreign Countries of Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; The statute prohibits significant transactions involving the material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity for leading-edge and advanced facilities in foreign countries of concern for 10 years from the date of award to stop recipients from constructing new or expanding existing leading-edge and advanced technology facilities in those countries. Today’s proposed rule defines significant transactions based on a monetary level of $100,000 and defines material expansion as increasing a facility's production capacity by five percent. These thresholds are intended to capture even modest transactions attempting to expand manufacturing capacity. If a CHIPS Incentives Program funding recipient engages in transactions violating these restrictions, the Department can claw back the entire funding award.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the Expansion of Legacy Facilities in Foreign Countries of Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;The statute places limits on the expansion and new construction of legacy facilities in foreign countries of concern. The proposed rule limits the expansion of existing legacy facilities, prohibiting recipients from adding new production lines or expanding a facility's production capacity beyond 10 percent. The statute also dictates that recipients may only build new legacy facilities if the output of those facilities “predominantly serves” the domestic market of the foreign country of concern where the legacy chips are produced. The proposed rule specifies that predominantly serving a market means at least 85% of the legacy facility’s output is incorporated into final products that are consumed in the foreign country of concern where they are produced. The proposed rule also notes that if any recipient plans to expand legacy chip facilities under these exceptions, they will be required to notify the Department so the Department can confirm compliance with national security guardrails.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classify Semiconductors as Critical to National Security:&lt;/strong&gt; While the statute allows companies to expand production of legacy chips in foreign countries of concern in limited circumstances, today’s proposed rule classifies a list of semiconductors as critical to national security – defining these chips as not considered to be a legacy chip and therefore subject to tighter restrictions. This measure will cover chips that are critical to U.S. national security needs, including current-generation and mature-node chips used for quantum computing, in radiation-intensive environments, and for other specialized military capabilities. This list of semiconductor chips was developed in consultation with the Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Community.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforce U.S. Export Controls: &lt;/strong&gt;In October 2022, the Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXMuZG9jLmdvdi9pbmRleC5waHAvZG9jdW1lbnRzL2Fib3V0LWJpcy9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8zMTU4LTIwMjItMTAtMDctYmlzLXByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UtYWR2YW5jZWQtY29tcHV0aW5nLWFuZC1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctY29udHJvbHMtZmluYWwvZmlsZSJ9.qoMbZ9TeLTOG3op_Cwg4aRYX_fjORWx8S0s-rKCQJvE/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuIg2nxc3g$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;implemented export controls&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the PRC from purchasing and manufacturing advanced chips that would enhance their military capabilities. Today’s proposed rule will reinforce these controls by aligning prohibited technology thresholds for memory chips between export controls and CHIPS national security guardrails. Today’s proposed rule applies a more restrictive threshold for logic chips than is used for export controls.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details Restrictions on Joint Research and Technology Licensing Efforts with Foreign Entities of Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;The statute restricts recipients from engaging in joint research or technology licensing efforts with a foreign entity of concern that relates to a technology or product that raises national security concerns. The proposed rule defines a joint research effort as any research and development undertaken by two or more persons, and it defines technology licensing as an agreement to make patents, trade secrets, or know-how available to another party. In addition to the foreign entities of concern outlined in the statute, the proposed rule also adds entities from the BIS Entity List, the Treasury Department’s Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) list, and the Federal Communications Commission’s Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act list of equipment and services posing national security risks. The proposed rule also details the technology, products, and semiconductors that raise national security concerns or are critical to national security, consistent with U.S. export controls and as developed in consultation with the Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Community.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department is seeking public comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and will accept comment for 60 days. Industry, partners and allies, and other interested parties are encouraged to &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-05869/preventing-the-improper-use-of-creating-helpful-incentives-to-produce-semiconductors-for-america-act" rel="noreferrer"&gt;submit comment&lt;/a&gt; to inform the final rule to be published later this year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed rule aligns with the national security guardrails included in the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDQsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hvbWUudHJlYXN1cnkuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvankxMzUzIn0.V9cvCTyqbMGZObhif-1ZHTXRAZHWZY5s0xgi1SWqcOU/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuIxp0fxRQ$" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking &lt;/a&gt;also issued today, which details the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (Investment Tax Credit) administered by the Internal Revenue Service. The Investment Tax Credit is a federal income tax credit for qualifying investments in facilities manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and a critical component of the suite of incentives provided by the CHIPS and Science Act. The Department of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury have been coordinating closely on CHIPS funding and the Investment Tax Credit to ensure these incentives are complementary and advance the Biden Administration’s economic and national security goals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Coordination with U.S Partners and Allies&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department has appreciated extensive input and cooperation from U.S. partners and allies while developing this proposed rule, and it looks forward to further public comment. The Department will continue coordinating with international allies and partners to support a healthy global semiconductor ecosystem that drives innovation and is resilient to cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical conflict, and more. As semiconductors and technologies continue to evolve, the U.S. will work with allies and partners and develop coordinated strategies to ensure the latest technology cannot be used by entities of concern to undermine our collective economic and national security.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Department has been implementing the CHIPS and Science Act, it has remained in close contact with U.S. partners and allies, including through engagements with the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDUsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLzA1L3JlYWRvdXQtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LXJhaW1vbmRvcy1tZWV0aW5nLWtvcmVhbi1taW5pc3Rlci10cmFkZS1pbmR1c3RyeS1hbmQifQ.KT7R8Xqtt0-cn1_R9-aHbXA4DlTU6h-pZxeqFm4lTcM/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuLAKgMx6A$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDYsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLzA3L2pvaW50LXN0YXRlbWVudC11cy1qYXBhbi1lY29ub21pYy1wb2xpY3ktY29uc3VsdGF0aXZlLWNvbW1pdHRlZSJ9.qIkCIyBhDPGfftZQz0ggnW1DYa27_j6uKQDklQMGVy0/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuIzYlq3qQ$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDcsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIzLzAzL3N0YXRlbWVudC11cy1zZWNyZXRhcnktY29tbWVyY2UtZ2luYS1yYWltb25kby11cy1pbmRpYS1tZW1vcmFuZHVtIn0.zPX7z58LxhH3UCPiB7hXg9cl9WG9DcvBV0JrY0eUeug/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuK3k9CbsA$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDgsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLzEwL3VzLXVrLWpvaW50LXN0YXRlbWVudC1uZXctY29tcHJlaGVuc2l2ZS1kaWFsb2d1ZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZC1kYXRhIn0.WD4GGM3ZJ0PpBolMmD0TW6Revaye_0XdyxDZuzULqtU/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuKkBMUJVA$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and through the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDksInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjZS5nb3YvaW5kby1wYWNpZmljLWVjb25vbWljLWZyYW1ld29yayJ9.lFb1Ffh_pdndmWP07IpUWMdnB3vy1PoHqgEAnY-PztE/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuJq4FBHPQ$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indo-Pacific Economic Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMTAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi8xMi8wNS9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LXUtcy1ldS10cmFkZS1hbmQtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1jb3VuY2lsLWFkdmFuY2VzLWNvbmNyZXRlLWFjdGlvbi1vbi10cmFuc2F0bGFudGljLWNvb3BlcmF0aW9uLyJ9.fX26b8PfpzvnoQrW7CiyiIoAwBW8Vob5ceVffEcIh7Q/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuIC6IfJFA$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;European Union-United States Trade and Technology Council&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMTEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMzAzMjEuNzM3MTM3OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wMS8xMC9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWtleS1kZWxpdmVyYWJsZXMtZm9yLXRoZS0yMDIzLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2FuLWxlYWRlcnMtc3VtbWl0LyJ9.rCwSLLYtj4MkB0FHZdl6c96pdhZXAhYPlUp6WBdMbgk/s/606887802/br/156481606591-l__;!!FiG2giev53vN!7L8Hs7Fd_C5AfqlmLWnNHL7sTtfT4FadbEdelipdJ1ETSAtN0GUxQgy0b61NRlYAPxHum6ZDhbQhBEdrj52MDAALpuIpqkxpDw$" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;North America Leaders’ Summit&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About CHIPS for America&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHIPS for America is part of President Biden’s economic plan to invest in America, stimulate private sector investment, create good-paying jobs, make more in the United States, and revitalize communities left behind. CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office, responsible for manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office, responsible for R&amp;D programs, that both sit within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the Department of Commerce. NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST is uniquely positioned to successfully administer the CHIPS for America program because of the bureau’s strong relationships with U.S. industries, its deep understanding of the semiconductor ecosystem, and its reputation as fair and trusted.

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New dashboard to provide updated data alongside the monthly jobs report release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Department of Commerce’s Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs (OUSEA) is announcing a new &lt;a href="//www.commerce.gov/bureaus-and-offices/ousea/spotlight-women-labor-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;spotlight on women and the labor force&lt;/a&gt;. The dashboard will reflect new data each month, alongside the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly release on the employment situation .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Department’s new dashboard demonstrates the power of data to uncover unique insights into women’s participation in the workforce and the economic impact,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Building upon our understanding of women’s labor participation through data, we will ultimately help bring more women into the workforce and advance a more inclusive and productive economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the unemployment rate has remained low and jobs recovery has remained strong, there are still persistent gender disparities within the American labor market. Women, comprising over half of the United States’ population, have had historically lower labor force participation rates than men. This is true even today, despite the current labor shortage and exceptional demand for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey suggest that one of the largest obstacles to achieving similar labor force participation rates between men and women are women’s disproportionate caregiving responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity remains at the heart of the Commerce Department’s mission. This dashboard will serve as a monthly data-driven reminder that more must be done as we build towards sustainable, employer-driven career pathways to meet employers’ need for talent and connect all Americans to quality jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) participated in the second negotiating round for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) in Bali, Indonesia, from March 13-19, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. interagency delegation was co-led by Sharon H. Yuan, U.S. Department of Commerce Counselor and IPEF Pillars II-IV Chief Negotiator and Sarah Ellerman, IPEF Pillar I Chief Negotiator and Assistant United States Trade Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific (Acting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In advance of the negotiations in Bali, USTR shared Pillar I (Trade) negotiating text with IPEF Partners for the following topics: labor, environment, digital trade, and technical assistance. This is in addition to negotiating text that was shared ahead of the Brisbane round for the following chapters: trade facilitation, agriculture, services domestic regulation, and transparency and good regulatory practices. Officials from Australia and New Zealand jointly shared a text proposal on inclusivity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Commerce shared negotiating text for Pillar II (Supply Chains) and Pillar IV (Fair Economy) in advance of the Brisbane round, and for Pillar III (Clean Economy) in advance of the special negotiating round in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bali, IPEF Partners exchanged views on the proposed new text and conducted follow-up conversations from the Brisbane and New Delhi rounds as they work to advance a shared vision for an open, connected, prosperous and resilient Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the margins of the Bali negotiating round, the U.S. delegation, pillar leads and the Chief Negotiators, held briefings with congressional staff and a diverse range of stakeholders to provide updates on the negotiations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these briefings underscore the Biden-Harris Administration’s strong commitment to transparency and providing the public with greater insight into the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF Partners have committed to an aggressive negotiating schedule throughout 2023.  The &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2022/december/joint-ustr-and-department-commerce-readout-first-indo-pacific-economic-framework-negotiating-round" rel="noreferrer"&gt;first negotiating round&lt;/a&gt; was held in Brisbane, Australia from December 10-15, 2022. Commerce also participated in a &lt;a href="//www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/02/us-department-commerce-readout-indo-pacific-economic-framework-special#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20Commerce,February%208%2D11%2C%202023." rel="noreferrer"&gt;special negotiating round&lt;/a&gt; in New Delhi, India from February 8-11, 2023. Commerce and USTR will release additional details about the next in-person negotiating round at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Joint Statement of India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue</title>
  <link>https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2023/03/joint-statement-india-us-commercial-dialogue</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Joint Statement of India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span lang="" about="https://www.commerce.gov/user/396" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name" datatype="" xml:lang=""&gt;DKunkel@doc.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden"&gt;Fri, 03/17/2023 - 17:00&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-release-datetime field--type-datetime field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2023-03-14T16:00:00Z" class="datetime"&gt;Tuesday, March 14, 2023&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field--name-field-news-media-contact field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items"&gt;
              &lt;div class="field__item"&gt;&lt;div about="https://www.commerce.gov/bureaus-and-offices/os/public-affairs" id="taxonomy-term-27" class="taxonomy-term vocabulary-bureaus-offices"&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-name field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Office of Public Affairs&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;div class="content"&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;div class="field field--name-field-email field--type-email field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:publicaffairs@doc.gov" rel="noreferrer"&gt;publicaffairs@doc.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. India and the United States of America held the 5th Ministerial level meeting of the bilateral Commercial Dialogue in New Delhi on 10 March 2023. India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, co-chaired and re-launched the Commercial Dialogue in accordance with the U.S.-India Joint Leaders’ Statement of September 2021, with a renewed focus on future and emerging areas of bilateral commercial partnership. The Commercial Dialogue is part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S.-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, develop inclusive and fair trade and investment policies, and leverage the interests of the private sector in pursuing new market opportunities that advance prosperity in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The Minister and the Secretary noted with satisfaction that the bilateral goods and services trade has almost doubled since 2014, exceeding U.S. $191 billion in 2022, signalling accelerated growth benefitting both countries. With the United States becoming India’s largest trading partner in 2022, both sides will take further steps to enhance their commercial collaboration and tap into market potential across multiple sectors. Both sides envision further coordination on how best to foster an enabling environment for increased investment, including by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-up companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Secretary Raimondo took note of India’s initiatives to bolster its infrastructure sector, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline and PM GatiShakti National Master Plan. She also took note of the objectives of India’s National Logistics Policy, which seeks to boost trade and enable digital transformation in India’s logistics sphere. Minister Goyal acknowledged and recognized the ambitious nature of U.S. initiatives such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, Inflation Reduction Act, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provide investment opportunities in domestic manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and accelerate the industries of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Both sides expressed a shared interest in exploring collaboration based on mutual trust and confidence, as furthering the economic integration of like-minded countries that share democratic values will bolster transparency, resilience, and security in global supply chains and boost economic prosperity in both countries, as well as the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Secretary Raimondo welcomed India’s active partnership in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and appreciated India’s hosting of the Special Round of negotiations for IPEF Pillars II-IV, between 8-11 February 2023 in New Delhi. The Minister and the Secretary noted that deepening economic engagement among IPEF partner countries is crucial for continued inclusive growth, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. They shared the conviction that IPEF will bring tangible benefits, including through technical assistance and capacity building, from enhanced investments flows; development of infrastructure, connectivity, and more resilient supply chains; facilitation of the clean economy transition to IPEF partner countries and the region at large; and strengthening of anticorruption efforts and tax administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. To strengthen supply chains in critical and emerging technology sectors, the Minister and the Secretary acknowledged the benefits of bilateral cooperation. They welcomed the recently launched U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), which elevates and expands the strategic technology partnership between the governments, businesses, and academic institutions of our two countries. The Minister and the Secretary intend for their collaboration to support iCET’s vision to build a trusted technology value chain partnership between the countries and make possible greater cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, co-development and co-production, and connectivity across our innovation ecosystems. Minister Goyal and Secretary Raimondo noted the importance of coordinating with the standing mechanism established by the two governments under iCET, which aims to address regulatory barriers and other issues that impede smooth economic and commercial ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. The Minister and the Secretary underscored the importance of the Commercial Dialogue in sustaining momentum on shared economic priorities. Towards that end, they confirmed their intention to convene before the end of 2023 a mid-year review led by senior government officials from both sides. The mid-year review will allow each side to carry forward the below priorities identified under the Commercial Dialogue, implementing a roadmap based on the Minister’s and the Secretary’s economic vision and ensuring robust private sector engagement to inform ongoing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Supply Chain Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Recognizing the importance of U.S. and Indian markets to the global electronics industry, Secretary Raimondo and Minister Goyal intend to utilize the Commercial Dialogue to enhance public and private efforts to promote industry cooperation in the semiconductor sector. These efforts will identify opportunities for growth and challenges to address in order to ensure that U.S. and Indian semiconductor industries develop stronger connections, complementary ecosystems, and a more diverse supply chain for semiconductors. Towards that end, the Minister and the Secretary welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a Semiconductor Sub-committee under the Commercial Dialogue, led by the Department of Commerce for the U.S. side and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and Ministry of Commerce and Industry for the Indian side. The Minister and the Secretary charged the Semiconductor Sub-committee with convening its first engagement in advance of any Commercial Dialogue mid-year review and reviewing recommendations from the joint industry led task force launched in connection with the iCET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. Both sides recognized the need for increased bilateral strategic and high technology trade and collaboration given the shared priority of building resilient and trusted global supply chains and the mutual interest in taking forward the outcomes of iCET. In that context, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Indian Ministry of External Affairs plan to launch an India-U.S. Strategic Trade Dialogue to address export controls, explore ways of enhancing high technology commerce, and facilitate technology transfer between the two countries. The Dialogue will be led by the Foreign Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, on the Indian side and by the Under Secretary for Industry and Security, Department of Commerce, for the U.S. side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10. The Minister and the Secretary share a concern that cyber threats such as unauthorized access, ransomware, and data destruction are growing, as is the need to protect against those threats. This need applies not only to the growing ecommerce, digital payments, and related services sectors, but also to connected manufacturing and critical infrastructure. Secretary Raimondo welcomed the opportunity to explore the potential for mutually beneficial engagement on cyber security and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as information sharing on cyber security and AI resources and approaches under established bilateral mechanisms such as the Commercial Dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11. Minister Goyal noted India’s interest in partnering with the United States in developing a secure pharmaceutical manufacturing base and diversifying supply chains for critical and strategic minerals (including rare earths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating Climate and Clean Technology Cooperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12. In order to help meet the critical need of enhancing our countries’ energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Minister and the Secretary pledged to facilitate greater connections between our industries, including through the development of platforms where opportunities and critical issues in the energy and clean tech sectors will be discussed. Towards that end, Minister Goyal took note of the U.S.-India Energy Industry Network (EIN) as a broad platform for facilitating U.S. industry involvement in the Clean EDGE Asia initiative, the U.S. government’s signature initiative to grow sustainable and secure clean energy markets throughout the Indo-Pacific region. The U.S. Department of Commerce is working to reinvigorate the EIN as a platform to discuss opportunities in the Indian energy sector through roundtable discussions, webinars, and other activities open to U.S. industry. Minister Goyal welcomed the opportunity for Indian companies to participate in these activities. He noted the potential for solar supply chains to be included in the EIN agenda, and the Minister and the Secretary concurred on the importance of the U.S.-India commercial partnership to reduce supply chain dependence for solar equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13. The two sides noted the strong impetus being given to comprehensive green energy development under the U.S.-India Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP). The SCEP is a reflection of the importance that the leaders of our two countries have placed in the green energy transition, the promotion of clean energy deployment, and the identification of low carbon pathways to development. In this context, the Minister and the Secretary expressed support for two key initiatives agreed upon during the recently concluded SCEP Ministerial Meeting—namely, the development and deployment of hydrogen technologies and the launch of a new Energy Storage Task Force. Both sides also pledged to work together in the Global Biofuels Alliance to be launched under India’s G20 presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14. Minister Goyal noted India’s interest in seeing greater U.S. collaboration on increasing access to components in the solar power value chain, increasing investment in battery storage, and manufacturing offshore wind turbines. The Minister noted the U.S. Department of Commerce’s intent to send a senior government official-led Clean Energy and Environmental Technology Business Development Mission to India in 2024. The trade mission would be an opportunity to further foster U.S.-Indian business partnerships in grid modernization and smart grid solutions, renewable energy, energy storage, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, and environmental technology solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive Digital Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15. Secretary Raimondo commended Minister Goyal for the impressive scale of India’s ambitions to increase ICT connectivity, promote digital inclusion, and improve efficiency in the delivery of government services through the use of digital tools. Taking note of the rapid pace of digitalization in our countries, Secretary Raimondo expressed interest in exploring ways to better reflect our “trusted partnership” in the digital realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16. While continuing to work on a range of digital trade issues in the U.S.-India Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Working Group and the Trade Policy Forum, both sides recognized the importance of cross border data flows in accordance with applicable domestic policies and legal frameworks. Both sides intend to continue engaging on cross border data flows and other relevant issues, including in appropriate multilateral fora. Both Ministers also expressed interest in working together in developing next generation standards in telecommunications, including 6G. They anticipate efforts to include cooperation between relevant government agencies, standards organisations, and industry bodies. Finally, both sides intend to further work together in validation and deployment of trusted and secure next generation telecom network equipment, including Open RAN, as well as in subsequent generations of telecommunications infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Pandemic Economic Recovery, Especially for SMEs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17. Recognizing that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of the U.S. and Indian economies, Minister Goyal and Secretary Raimondo concurred on the need to facilitate collaboration between the SMEs of the two countries and to foster innovation ecosystems that facilitate their post-pandemic economic recovery and growth. Acknowledging that India and the United States are the world’s 3rd largest and largest start-up ecosystems, respectively, the Minister and the Secretary shared a keen interest in harnessing opportunities for closer integration of both ecosystems, especially in emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18. The Minister and the Secretary further acknowledged that the movement of professionals and skilled workers, students, investors, and business travelers between the countries, consistent with their respective legal requirements, contributes significantly to enhancing U.S.-India bilateral, economic, and technological partnership. They recognized that supporting more travel between our two countries will also assist the travel industry in recovering post-pandemic, benefitting SMEs in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19. In this context, Minister Goyal and Secretary Raimondo announced the launch of a new Working Group on Talent, Innovation and Inclusive Growth under the Commercial Dialogue, led at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level for the U.S. Department of Commerce and by the Joint Secretary (NAFTA) for the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This Working Group would also support efforts under iCET, particularly in identifying specific regulatory hurdles to cooperation and fostering greater connectivity between our innovation ecosystems (including tech start-ups). It would further provide specific ideas for joint activities, such as organising dedicated pitching sessions and expos, and work towards identifying new innovations and matching them with industry requirements across priority sectors already identified under the iCET framework. The Minister and the Secretary charged the Working Group with convening its first engagement in advance of any Commercial Dialogue mid-year review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20. The Minister and the Secretary acknowledged the past work done through the Travel and Tourism Working Group under the Commercial Dialogue. As both countries continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Minister and the Secretary intend to re-launch the Travel and Tourism Working Group to continue the progress from before the pandemic and to also address the many new challenges and opportunities to create a stronger travel and tourism sector and better experiences for travelers between our two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standards and Conformance Cooperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21. The Minister and the Secretary recognized the desire of both countries to facilitate bilateral trade through improved information sharing and dialogue between the public and private sectors on technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. They noted the past work done through the Standards Cooperation workstream under the Commercial Dialogue and concurred on the importance of continued engagement in this important area, which cuts across different sectors, including environmental services, clean technologies, ICT, transportation, logistics, pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and food products (including organic products). Building upon the success of the first and second phases of the U.S.-India Standards and Conformance Cooperation Program (SCCP) as funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Minister and the Secretary inaugurated SCCP Phase III for Fiscal Year 2023-2024, to be carried out in partnership between ANSI (American National Standard Institute) from the U.S. side and BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) from the Indian side in furtherance of standards cooperation between the United States and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-India CEO Forum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22. The Minister and the Secretary welcomed the holding of a U.S.-India CEO Forum meeting after the re-launch of the CEO Forum in November 2022, during which they shared their strategic priorities for the bilateral relationship with CEO Forum members. Both sides noted with appreciation the valued service and dedication of CEO Forum members from the United States and India, as well as their well-considered joint recommendations for the two governments. Both governments are working to examine the CEO recommendations for appropriate action to enhance the economic landscape and ties between India and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;23. Secretary Raimondo welcomed India’s ongoing G20 Presidency with the theme of “One Earth, One Family, One Future” and expressed a shared interest in ensuring substantive outcomes, particularly in trade and investment. The Minister and the Secretary look forward to the next Commercial Dialogue meeting, to be held in Washington, DC, in 2024. They will take forward the agenda discussed and outcomes identified, contributing towards a growing strategic and economic relationship between India and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*******&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;div class="field__item"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/about/leadership/don-graves" hreflang="en"&gt;Don Graves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Thank you for that kind introduction, and thanks to the SATELLITE 2023 team and the Satellite Industry Association for inviting me to speak today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our job at the Commerce Department is to improve America’s competitiveness so that our companies can succeed in the global economy. We want to ensure the United States remains the flag of choice for businesses operating in space. That means engaging with industry to support innovation, expand business opportunities, and provide the clarity, consistency, and transparency that you need to invest and compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;A year ago, I addressed the SIA Leadership Dinner and announced that the Commerce Department was prioritizing the commercial space industry in our new strategic plan. Today, I am happy to report we have made significant progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;In the past year, we established a new Commercial Space Coordination Committee, which I chair. It includes the heads of nearly every Commerce bureau and offers a forum to engage the “whole of Commerce” on key space-related issues. This reflects the reality that our work expanding space commerce isn’t confined to one office or bureau, but involves international trade, economic development , broadband-expansion efforts, NIST cybersecurity expertise, and even minority business outreach to expand our supplier base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We also appointed a Director to run our Office of Space Commerce: Richard DalBello, whom many of you know from his decades of service to this industry, including several years as president of SIA. Richard serves as vice chair on the Coordination Committee, and we meet regularly to discuss issues impacting the commercial space industry and how each bureau can further the U.S. space industry. As I mentioned last year, I have a strong personal interest in space matters and seek to engage wherever I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Department’s strategic plan on space commerce outlines five areas of focus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class="Remarks"&gt;Coordinating regulatory functions;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="Remarks"&gt;Growing the customer base for U.S. commercial space goods and services;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="Remarks"&gt;Improving space safety and sustainability;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="Remarks"&gt;Promoting commercial space innovation;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="Remarks"&gt;Advancing Earth observation capabilities to empower better decision making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Let me update you on our progress across these strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating Regulatory Functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;First, our work to coordinate regulatory functions cuts across domestic and international stakeholders and is designed to promote competitiveness and increase legal certainty, transparency, and consistency for commercial space businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Today, private capital is funding traditional space investments such as communications, remote sensing satellites, and new business concepts such as in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing; active debris removal; and asteroid mining. These ventures don’t necessarily fit under existing regulatory frameworks, which creates new opportunities and challenges when it comes to federal oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt; We  are working toward better coordination among federal agencies to simplify the process for commercial space licensing for stakeholders, including incumbent corporations and startup space innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Commerce is uniquely positioned to help address the situation, as we lead or co-lead three of the four major regulatory processes affecting space. Through NOAA, we have the lead for licensing commercial remote sensing satellites. Through NTIA, we manage the nation’s use of radiofrequency spectrum along with the FCC. And through our Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, we regulate space export controls along with the State Department. We recently reorganized NOAA’s Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs office as part of our effort to raise the focus of space regulation in the Department. We consolidated it into the Office of Space Commerce and elevated the combined organization to become part of the Office of the NOAA Under Secretary. This has raised the office’s visibility and allowed it to advance its commercial agenda. My office also works directly with the Office of Space Commerce to ensure that it’s getting the attention it deserves at the highest levels in our Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;You may recall that, in 2020, NOAA rewrote its regulations on commercial remote sensing to take future innovation into account. As a result, the majority of Earth imaging satellites need only simple licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Over the past year, NOAA’s licensing has improved in speed and efficiency, even as we’ve seen an increase in the number of applications. In 2022, the average time to process a new license application was 22 days – a 20% improvement over the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Export control is another area where we have made progress recently. Due to the United States’ obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime, or MTCR, we have policies about providing support or encouragement to foreign space launch vehicles, as the technology is the same used in missile programs. Implementing those policies has often led to restrictions being applied to commercial satellites and satellite components planned for launch on space launch vehicles we did not support or encourage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;In recognition of the growing space cooperation environment, the U.S. government undertook a careful review of how MTCR policy was being interpreted. Today, I am happy to announce a clarification to the policy. License applications for the export of satellites and satellite components to MTCR Partners will now be reviewed on a case-by-case basis – not with a presumption of denial – even if the launch vehicle is one that the United States does not encourage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;That may seem like a subtle distinction. But for those of you who have been denied satellite exports to certain MTCR countries due to the choice of launch vehicle, this change of interpretation will have major business implications. It will open the door to potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in new exports of U.S. satellite and satellite components. Please reach out to BIS for details on how this may affect your license applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing the Customer Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Moving on to our second area of focus, we are growing the customer base for U.S. commercial space goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Commerce’s International Trade Administration works with U.S. commercial space companies to help them win business overseas. If you are a U.S. company and you have not yet taken advantage of their services, I encourage you to reach out to the ITA Advocacy Center and learn what they have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Over the past year, the Advocacy Center has contributed to seven international space contract wins with a total value of about $406 million. They are currently working on 29 cases involving the space industry, with a total estimated value of $8.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our Office of Space Commerce is also leading efforts to facilitate international space business collaboration. Last November, as part of the inaugural U.S.-France Comprehensive Space Dialogue held in Paris, the office organized a special session involving government and industry representatives from both nations. This “Track 1.5” event focused on increasing U.S.-France business partnerships by identifying barriers that could be removed through governmental cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Track 1.5 event was very successful – so much so, that when President Macron came to Washington for his state visit later in the month, I personally briefed him on this activity. In our meeting and in the industry roundtable I co-hosted at NASA headquarters, he took a clear interest in increasing business between our two space industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Based on that success, we are now planning a Track 1.5 engagement as part of the next U.S.-Japan Comprehensive Space Dialogue. We will be taking a delegation of American space companies with us to Tokyo next week to hold similar discussions with our Japanese counterparts from government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;At the U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit in December, I moderated a Space Forum session to discuss the private sector’s role in supporting a U.S.-Africa partnership. I believe space technologies and space commerce, aided by the U.S. private sector, can play an important role in driving technological and private sector development in Africa. We are actively planning further commercial space engagements with African nations later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Another aspect of our efforts is promoting the availability, security, and resilience of our space industrial base and supply chains. As a first step, last week BIS launched an assessment of our industrial base in partnership with NASA and NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;BIS is now deploying a survey instrument to hundreds of U.S. space companies and suppliers. The data collected will help identify the structure and interdependencies of organizations that support NASA and NOAA systems and subsystems. Please look for these surveys in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Space Safety/Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our third area of focus is improving space safety and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;This is a top priority for us. With thousands of satellites being launched each year, we must act quickly to prevent catastrophic collisions that could render Earth’s orbits useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Congress recognizes this as a priority as well. Our Office of Space Commerce received a $70 million appropriation for FY 2023 – a huge increase over prior years. The majority of that funding is going into the space situational awareness, or SSA, system that the Commerce Department was tasked to develop under Space Policy Directive 3, the National Space Traffic Management Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Commerce is taking over responsibility to provide SSA data and services to commercial and civil space operators from the Department of Defense, so DOD can focus its resources on national security matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The congressional funding came with a deadline of September 2024 to field the initial operating capability of our SSA system, and we are working hard to meet that deadline. Our initial capability will only provide a subset of the services we envision, but it will provide meaningful traffic safety coordination to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We recently rebranded our system to be called “TraCSS” – the Traffic Coordination System for Space. I hope you agree that “TraCSS” is an improvement on the original name, “Open Architecture Data Repository.” To build TraCSS, the Office of Space Commerce is leveraging NOAA’s experience in acquiring and managing large data systems for weather observations and forecasting. We are going to partner with industry to the maximum extent possible to minimize disruption to the existing commercial market for advanced SSA services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Input from leaders in SSA is crucial, which is why I have had continued conversations with industry on this topic. We are seeking to strike the right balance between providing too many services, which might overlap with industry, and providing too few services, which might drive users toward competing, foreign SSA systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Last month, the Office of Space Commerce and DoD wrapped up a two-month pilot project to demonstrate the capability of U.S. commercial data and commercial analytics services to provide SSA to about 100 spacecraft. The pilot involved GEO space object tracking data obtained through five commercial contracts, plus SSA data analysis performed under seven additional contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Commercial GEO Pilot appears to have been a success, providing satellite operators with spaceflight safety services comparable to what they normally get from DoD. The pilot also provided valuable insights that have been incorporated into the planning for TraCSS. The Office of Space Commerce is now considering options for additional pilots while the operational TraCSS system is in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our fourth area of focus is about promoting innovation, which is foundational to everything we do at the Commerce Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;In practice, this can take many forms, from research and development at NIST and NOAA, to intellectual property protections by the Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;One program that has made notable progress in the past year is NOAA’s Commercial Data Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;For the past couple of years, NOAA has been buying commercial radio occultation satellite data and using it to improve operational weather forecasts. But until recently, that data could only be shared with other federal agencies and international weather bureaus, or shared after a 24-hour delay. Beginning in January, NOAA has been obtaining this data with the most liberal distribution rights, so that anyone in the world can freely access it in near real time, and use it for scientific or commercial purposes. NOAA is only buying a subset of the vendor’s full daily output, so the unlimited sharing does not prevent the company from selling its services to other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;NOAA also awarded contracts last summer for a pilot study in support of space weather, and they are currently reviewing other commercially available satellite data that could benefit NOAA in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;We’re also promoting commercial space innovation by expanding spectrum availability. We know that next-generation satellite systems – and new space enterprises built to service and work with those systems – are going to need spectrum to develop to their full potential. We will do all that we can to ensure that spectrum is available both for federal and private sector missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The Department is committed to allocating this valuable resource thoughtfully and judiciously, considering commercial sector needs while reaffirming our commitment to protect critical federal missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;To that end, NTIA just kicked off the development of a National Spectrum Strategy that will, we hope, create a process that can satisfy the nation’s spectrum needs for the next decade. We are seeking feedback from industry, our federal agency partners and all spectrum stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;NTIA also oversees the Administration’s broadband deployment efforts. Innovative space-based operations are key to enabling connectivity for all, not just in our country, but around the world, where billions of people still lack basic connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And we have been working through the ITU to improve global connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;I invite all of you to continue to work with us in the pursuit of innovative strategies for connecting those in America and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing Earth Observation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Our fifth area of focus is advancing our Earth observation capabilities to empower more informed decision-making by the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;To collect observations for weather forecasting and climate monitoring, NOAA flies the nation’s fleet of operational, civilian satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;At the beginning of this year, NOAA declared its new GOES-18 satellite operational and designated it as GOES West. GOES West observes weather and climate conditions over the western United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Pacific Ocean. Even before becoming GOES-West, GOES-18 proved its value, providing operational data from its Advanced Baseline Imager, or “ABI,” to augment GOES-17 during the 2022 hurricane season. With design improvements to the ABI loop heat pipe, GOES-18 will be a persistent “eye in the sky” for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;And just two days ago, NOAA and NASA announced the award of a $765 million contract [to L3Harris] to develop the next-generation “GXI” imager for the GOES-R follow-on satellites, known as “GeoXO." GeoXO’s advanced capabilities will help address our changing planet and the evolving needs of NOAA’s data users. NOAA and NASA are working to ensure these critical observations are in place by the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Over the last few years, NOAA has been reimagining what its future satellite architecture could look like. NOAA has been engaging with the community and issued study contracts to develop a more advanced and agile architecture in Low Earth Orbit and for space weather. We are building in on-ramps for new technology and opening the door to more data purchases, rideshares, and hosted payloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;As a pathfinder demonstration toward a potentially disaggregated LEO constellation, NOAA is developing the QuickSounder mission. QuickSounder will be a small satellite carrying an existing, proven microwave sounder to measure vertical temperature and moisture profiles. But the instrument is not what’s important here – it’s the architecture, and the test of NOAA’s ability to quickly react to an on-orbit need. What they are pathfinding is NOAA’s ability to purchase and develop small form factor satellite buses and small launch services – with a timeline of a few years, rather than a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;The QuickSounder mission passed its Milestone 2 – the authority to proceed – in December, and is moving forward to launch in three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;To be clear, QuickSounder is one small satellite in LEO. If it is successful, then the next step is to develop a group of LEO smallsats and test how that goes. Ultimately, if all goes well, NOAA could potentially replace large multi-instrument satellites for some of NOAA’s core observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;So that may have seemed like a firehose of information, and I didn’t even get to talk about semiconductors and CHIPS for America!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;What I hope you’ll take away from my remarks today is that the Department of Commerce is fully engaged with our commercial space industry. We are pursuing new avenues for business, promoting innovation, and providing regulatory clarity, consistency and transparency that will allow the U.S. to remain the flag of choice in commercial space business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;America’s commercial space industry is vital to our country’s continued global competitiveness. The satellite industry is advancing new technologies, creating good paying jobs, combating climate change, and keeping Americans and the world connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;All of us at the Department of Commerce are eager to deepen our partnership with you and ensure that the U.S. remains the global leader in space. I hope you’ll continue to partner with us in the months and weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Remarks"&gt;Thank you once again for having me today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
