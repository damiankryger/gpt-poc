					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>The following is the joint statement released by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State and the Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Japan and the Republic of Korea following a trilateral meeting in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Mori Takeo, and Republic of Korea (ROK) First Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyundong met today in Washington, D.C. to deepen cooperation among the three countries on pressing global issues. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the trilateral partnership, grounded in their shared values and dedicated to their shared security and prosperity, as evidenced by their three vice-ministerial dialogues in the past year and numerous other coordination efforts. Today’s discussion also built upon the November 2022 leader-level Phnom Penh Statement on Trilateral Partnership for the Indo-Pacific as well as the September 2022 Joint Statement on the U.S.-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministerial.</p>
<p><span>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers expressed their deep condolences to the people of Türkiye and Syria in the aftermath of the devastating recent earthquake and committed to continue building upon the emergency aid already delivered by their three countries. </span><span> </span></p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and the Vice Ministers strongly condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) unlawful ballistic missile launches, which reached an unprecedented number in 2022, as well as a flurry of conventional military action and its threat of further destabilizing actions. They confirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and called on all UN member states to consistently implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions. They committed themselves to further strengthening and diversifying security cooperation to counter the threat the DPRK poses to regional and global security. The Deputy Secretary reiterated that the U.S. commitments to defend Japan and the ROK are ironclad and backed by the full range of capabilities, including nuclear, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to strengthen extended deterrence with Japan and the ROK. The Deputy Secretary and the Vice Ministers condemned the DPRK’s increasingly aggressive rhetoric regarding its nuclear program and called on the DPRK to immediately cease its irresponsible actions and to abide by its obligations under all relevant UN Security Council resolutions. They called on the DPRK to return to the negotiating table and reiterated that the only path to peace and stability is through sustained dialogue. To this end, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Mori expressed support for the goal of the ROK’s “Audacious Initiative.” The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers expressed grave concern over the human rights situation in the DPRK and underscored the importance of strengthening cooperation to improve the human rights situation in the DPRK, and in this context, the Vice Ministers welcomed the nomination of the U.S. Special Envoy on DPRK Human Rights Issues. They also committed to work together to achieve an immediate resolution to the abductions issue as well as the immediate release of ROK citizens detained in the DPRK.</p>
<p>The three countries lauded the resounding success of the 2022 trilateral exercises on ballistic missile defense and anti-submarine warfare, which they committed to continue. They further committed to determining new areas for security cooperation and reaffirmed their intention to share DPRK missile warning data in real time as expressed by the Leaders in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Noting the upcoming one-year mark of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed their determination to stand firmly with Ukraine and strongly condemned Russia&#8217;s ongoing attacks, which are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. They reiterated their unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. They stated unequivocally that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable and that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be an act of hostility against humanity and unjustifiable in any way. They committed to continue collaboration to impose strong sanctions against Russia and provide assistance for Ukraine, including rehabilitating Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and addressing Ukraine’s future economic needs.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed their strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, including in the Indo-Pacific. They reiterated their firm commitment to the rule of law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They emphasized that their basic positions on Taiwan remained unchanged and reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed the outcomes of the November 2022 leader-level Phnom Penh Statement and underscored their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, resilient, and secure, is best achieved by leveraging each of their countries’ unique advantages and experiences in the region. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the announcement of the ROK’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and hoped it would facilitate trilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Based on their firm support for ASEAN centrality and unity as well as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers committed to coordinate closely with ASEAN partners and within ASEAN-led regional architecture to address the full range of regional challenges, including climate change, digital connectivity, security, public health, and sustainable and inclusive economic growth. They committed to further enhancing cooperation for the development of the Mekong sub-region within the sub-regional cooperation frameworks including the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) and the Mekong River Commission.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reasserted their commitment to the Pacific Island countries and the importance of working in partnership with the Pacific Islands in a transparent and effective way guided by the Pacific Islands Forum’s 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They dedicated themselves to work together, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, and Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the ROK’s joining of the partnership and the ROK’s plan to hold the first Korea-Pacific Islands Summit this year. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Cho also welcomed Japan’s cooperation with the Pacific Island countries on the forthcoming Ministerial Interim Meeting ahead of the tenth Pacific Island Leaders Meeting (PALM10).</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers affirmed their shared commitment to strengthening consultation among the three governments on economic security, including the dialogue the Leaders announced in Phnom Penh. They concurred on the urgent need to address economic security challenges and reaffirmed their commitment to stand up to economic coercion.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers further committed to use and strengthen existing platforms and leadership mechanisms to address pressing global challenges including the need to protect human rights, prevent democratic backsliding, ensure equitable and transparent economic growth, and advance global women’s economic empowerment. In that regard, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the ROK’s upcoming role as the regional co-host of the second Summit for Democracy. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers shared the importance of the deepening of a trilateral development policy coordination, including among USAID, JICA, and KOICA. They committed to promoting transparent and responsible development finance in cooperation with international financial institutions. The Deputy Secretary and First Vice Minister Cho commended Japan for hosting the upcoming G7 Ministerial Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. They also committed to cooperate on a cancer moonshot initiative and, as a first step, to hold a trilateral dialogue between their respective national cancer centers to explore research and treatment areas that can uniquely benefit from the expertise of the three countries.</p>
<p>Throughout their discussions, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers underscored that U.S.-Japan-ROK cooperation is vital not only to the security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region but also to their shared global interests. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers look forward to further strengthening the trilateral partnership at their next meeting in the ROK.</p>

They stated unequivocally that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable and that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be an act of hostility against humanity and unjustifiable in any way. They committed to continue collaboration to impose strong sanctions against Russia and provide assistance for Ukraine, including rehabilitating Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and addressing Ukraine’s future economic needs.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed their strong opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, including in the Indo-Pacific. They reiterated their firm commitment to the rule of law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They emphasized that their basic positions on Taiwan remained unchanged and reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity for the international community.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reaffirmed the outcomes of the November 2022 leader-level Phnom Penh Statement and underscored their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, resilient, and secure, is best achieved by leveraging each of their countries’ unique advantages and experiences in the region. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the announcement of the ROK’s Indo-Pacific Strategy and hoped it would facilitate trilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Based on their firm support for ASEAN centrality and unity as well as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers committed to coordinate closely with ASEAN partners and within ASEAN-led regional architecture to address the full range of regional challenges, including climate change, digital connectivity, security, public health, and sustainable and inclusive economic growth. They committed to further enhancing cooperation for the development of the Mekong sub-region within the sub-regional cooperation frameworks including the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) and the Mekong River Commission.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers reasserted their commitment to the Pacific Island countries and the importance of working in partnership with the Pacific Islands in a transparent and effective way guided by the Pacific Islands Forum’s 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They dedicated themselves to work together, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, and Deputy Secretary Sherman and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the ROK’s joining of the partnership and the ROK’s plan to hold the first Korea-Pacific Islands Summit this year. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Cho also welcomed Japan’s cooperation with the Pacific Island countries on the forthcoming Ministerial Interim Meeting ahead of the tenth Pacific Island Leaders Meeting (PALM10).</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers affirmed their shared commitment to strengthening consultation among the three governments on economic security, including the dialogue the Leaders announced in Phnom Penh. They concurred on the urgent need to address economic security challenges and reaffirmed their commitment to stand up to economic coercion.</p>
<p>The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers further committed to use and strengthen existing platforms and leadership mechanisms to address pressing global challenges including the need to protect human rights, prevent democratic backsliding, ensure equitable and transparent economic growth, and advance global women’s economic empowerment. In that regard, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Minister Mori welcomed the ROK’s upcoming role as the regional co-host of the second Summit for Democracy. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers shared the importance of the deepening of a trilateral development policy coordination, including among USAID, JICA, and KOICA. They committed to promoting transparent and responsible development finance in cooperation with international financial institutions. The Deputy Secretary and First Vice Minister Cho commended Japan for hosting the upcoming G7 Ministerial Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. They also committed to cooperate on a cancer moonshot initiative and, as a first step, to hold a trilateral dialogue between their respective national cancer centers to explore research and treatment areas that can uniquely benefit from the expertise of the three countries.</p>
<p>Throughout their discussions, the Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers underscored that U.S.-Japan-ROK cooperation is vital not only to the security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region but also to their shared global interests. The Deputy Secretary and Vice Ministers look forward to further strengthening the trilateral partnership at their next meeting in the ROK.</p>

		<title>Convention on Biological Diversity Adopts Landmark Global Biodiversity Framework to Protect Nature</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Delegates to the Convention on Biological Diversity 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) in Montreal adopted a sweeping and ambitious Global Biodiversity Framework committing, for the first time, to conserving or protecting at least 30 percent of global lands and waters by 2030. President Biden committed the United States to the same goal during his first days in office.</p>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy for Biodiversity and Water Resources Monica Medina celebrated the framework as a win for nature, biodiversity, and humanity, noting that by conserving at least 30 percent of global lands, fresh water, and ocean by 2030 we are acting on what the science demands to address the precipitous decline in biodiversity worldwide.</p>
<p>More than one million species are at risk of extinction &#8211; many within decades &#8211; and more than ever before in our history. This drop in biodiversity endangers all life on our planet. Scientists in both the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), concluded that biodiversity is declining at a catastrophic rate and that the effective conservation of 30-50 percent of global lands and waters could preserve nature’s ability to sustain people and the planet.</p>
<p>To further address the loss of species, parties at COP15 adopted ambitious targets on ecosystem restoration, sustainable use of biodiversity, reductions in harmful pollutants, and inclusion of Indigenous peoples and local communities in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The framework also calls for a substantial increase in resources from all sources devoted to nature conservation. The United States has already been making progress towards supporting such efforts in the first two years of the Biden-Harris Administration, with for the U.S.’s largest pledge ever to the Global Environment Facility and a 20 percent increase in its spending on biodiversity foreign assistance.</p>
<p>With the adoption of the Global Biodiversity Framework, governments at all levels and all of society have a common set of goals to address the biodiversity crisis &#8211; for people and the planet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Walter E. Washington Convention Center</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone, and a big thank you, Hayde, to you for keeping us moving, and I will try to stay on your good side.  (Laughter.)  But it’s an honor to be joined at this table by so many leaders, so many colleagues – among other, President Tshisekedi – it’s very good to be with you – President Ramkalawan, President Hichilema, President Buhari, President Obiang, President Bongo Ondimba – thank you, thank you, thank you for your partnership, for your partnership to help preserve our planet.</p>
<p>We’re also joined today by members of Congress, members of the Biden Cabinet – I think Congressman Meeks is about to join us if he’s not already here – we have representatives from multilateral organizations, philanthropies, private sector leaders, activists, academics, youth leaders.  To each and every one of you, welcome.</p>
<p>The diversity of this group is heartening – a statement not merely of how we’re all affected by the climate crisis, but how committed we all are to working together to address it.</p>
<p>Last month many of us were in Egypt for COP27.  An African COP was a recognition that, as the urgency of the climate crisis grows, our focus must increasingly be on Africa.</p>
<p>As we know, 17 of the world’s 20 most climate vulnerable countries are on the African continent.</p>
<p>Four straight years of drought in the Horn of Africa have left more than 18 million people facing severe hunger.</p>
<p>Communities across the continent are feeling the impact of a changing climate.  Severe storms have battered southern Africa; surging temperatures kindle wildfires in northern Africa; rising seas threaten lives and livelihoods on island nations, while extreme weather events in central Africa worsen already-dire food crises and fuel tensions that feed and fuel violent conflict.</p>
<p>We know that African nations have contributed relatively little to this crisis but are disproportionally harmed by it.  It’s both unfair and unrealistic to ask them to turn their backs on economic development and opportunity in the name of a clean energy transition, to ask them in effect to forego what many of us have done in the past in developing our countries and our economies.</p>
<p>And so we believe that the best way – indeed, the just way – to address the climate crisis in Africa is to work together.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out President Biden’s new Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa.  It’s based on a simple idea: we can’t achieve any of our shared priorities – tackle any of our biggest challenges – unless we do it together as equal partners.</p>
<p>That’s true of every major issue we face today, and it’s particularly true of climate change. So here’s how we’re addressing this crisis together.</p>
<p>First, we are partnering to conserve ecosystems.  Africa is home to some of the world’s most precious ecosystems, which are critical for combating climate change.  This summer I visited the Democratic Republic of Congo, where forests absorb more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.  The Congo Basin is also a place of tremendous biodiversity, a lifeforce for agriculture across the region.</p>
<p>To support the sustainable management of the Congo Basin rainforest, we’ve invested over $600 million in the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment, which brings together the U.S. Government and African and U.S. NGOs.</p>
<p>And we’re building new coalitions between African governments, the private sector, civil society to protect other vital ecosystems across the continent.</p>
<p>Oceans are also a key part of this fight.  That’s why we’ve launched the Ocean Conservation Pledge to encourage countries to commit to protect at least 30 percent of their ocean waters by the year 2030.</p>
<p>Second, we’re partnering to make commitments and communities more resilient in the face of climate change.  The President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience is working with national governments to help more than half a billion people in developing countries manage the impacts of climate change.  This and other initiatives to support climate-resilient agriculture are increasingly critical as Russia’s war of aggression compounds the impact on food security.</p>
<p>At COP, the President also announced a doubling of our pledged contributions to the Adaptation Fund, which has deployed nearly $1 billion to help over 36 million people in the most vulnerable communities around the world.  And we committed to begin discussions on loss and damage funding arrangements to support low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Third, we’re partnering to advance a just transition to a clean energy economy that both saves our planet and fosters inclusive economic opportunity.</p>
<p>Africa will be at the center of the clean energy transition.  Its renewable energy potential is second to none.  It’s home to roughly a third of all critical minerals, essential to the technology that will power the clean energy economy, like batteries for renewable energy storage and wind turbines.  But with nearly half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lacking reliable access to electricity and the population set to grow to more than two billion people by 2050, how that transition is made will be decisive in shaping our future climate.</p>
<p>The United States will work closely with African countries as they determine how best to meet their specific energy needs – understanding that, for many, the clean energy transition will be a transition to consistent, reliable energy in the first place.  We’ll do so through programs like Power Africa, which has mobilized the public and private sectors to deliver cleaner, more reliable electricity to over 165 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa who previously didn’t have access.  We’re proud to announce a new investment of $290 million in that program.</p>
<p>Too often, those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of these changes have been denied a seat at the decision-making table.  We’re committed to changing that, including through the new Accelerating Women’s Empowerment in Energy project, which is making sure that women have a say in how their countries move forward on clean energy.</p>
<p>All of these efforts recognize that combating the climate crisis, like so many other challenges we face, was actually championed by Africans in the first place.  Indeed, in Africa, we see not only the stakes of this crisis, but also the solutions.  Gabon has led the way in conserving its forest resources, which now absorb 140 million tons of CO2 every year.  That’s the equivalent of taking 30 million cars off the road.</p>
<p>The Seychelles has pioneered the world’s first sovereign blue bond to marshal public and private investment for sustainable marine and fisheries projects.  It’s on the way to conserving 30 percent of its ocean waters – that’s an area the size of Zimbabwe – by 2030.</p>
<p>Zambia is harnessing the power of its wetlands and forests to mitigate climate impacts, benefiting tens of thousands of people vulnerable to both floods and to droughts.</p>
<p>Nigeria has set bold targets and robust regulations for methane reductions – the first country in Africa to do so – which could reduce air pollutants by a third and avert tens of thousands of deaths.</p>
<p>Equatorial Guinea just raised its commitment to cut emissions by 35 percent by 2030.  And the DRC has hosted the pre-COP27 meetings in Kinshahsa.  It’s teaming up with the United States on a broad scope of these issues through our Sustainable Development Solutions Working Group.</p>
<p>Today, and throughout this summit over the course of this week, I look forward to hearing from this group on how we can most effectively deepen our partnership to the benefit of all of our people, and indeed to the benefit of people around the world.  And I look forward to continuing this conversation in the months and also the years to come.  This is an enduring project for all of us, but I think we also all feel the fierce urgency of now.  And that determination is reflected in so much of the work that is being done and is being represented in this room.</p>
<p>With that, it is a pleasure and honor to turn the floor over to President Tshisekedi to offer some remarks.  Mr. President, the floor is now yours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Walter E. Washington Convention Center</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone, and a big thank you, Hayde, to you for keeping us moving, and I will try to stay on your good side.  (Laughter.)  But it’s an honor to be joined at this table by so many leaders, so many colleagues – among other, President Tshisekedi – it’s very good to be with you – President Ramkalawan, President Hichilema, President Buhari, President Obiang, President Bongo Ondimba – thank you, thank you, thank you for your partnership, for your partnership to help preserve our planet.</p>
<p>We’re also joined today by members of Congress, members of the Biden Cabinet – I think Congressman Meeks is about to join us if he’s not already here – we have representatives from multilateral organizations, philanthropies, private sector leaders, activists, academics, youth leaders.  To each and every one of you, welcome.</p>
<p>The diversity of this group is heartening – a statement not merely of how we’re all affected by the climate crisis, but how committed we all are to working together to address it.</p>
<p>Last month many of us were in Egypt for COP27.  An African COP was a recognition that, as the urgency of the climate crisis grows, our focus must increasingly be on Africa.</p>
<p>As we know, 17 of the world’s 20 most climate vulnerable countries are on the African continent.</p>
<p>Four straight years of drought in the Horn of Africa have left more than 18 million people facing severe hunger.</p>
<p>Communities across the continent are feeling the impact of a changing climate.  Severe storms have battered southern Africa; surging temperatures kindle wildfires in northern Africa; rising seas threaten lives and livelihoods on island nations, while extreme weather events in central Africa worsen already-dire food crises and fuel tensions that feed and fuel violent conflict.</p>
<p>We know that African nations have contributed relatively little to this crisis but are disproportionally harmed by it.  It’s both unfair and unrealistic to ask them to turn their backs on economic development and opportunity in the name of a clean energy transition, to ask them in effect to forego what many of us have done in the past in developing our countries and our economies.</p>
<p>And so we believe that the best way – indeed, the just way – to address the climate crisis in Africa is to work together.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in South Africa, I had an opportunity to set out President Biden’s new Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa.  It’s based on a simple idea: we can’t achieve any of our shared priorities – tackle any of our biggest challenges – unless we do it together as equal partners.</p>
<p>That’s true of every major issue we face today, and it’s particularly true of climate change. So here’s how we’re addressing this crisis together.</p>
<p>First, we are partnering to conserve ecosystems.  Africa is home to some of the world’s most precious ecosystems, which are critical for combating climate change.  This summer I visited the Democratic Republic of Congo, where forests absorb more carbon than is emitted by the entire continent of Africa.  The Congo Basin is also a place of tremendous biodiversity, a lifeforce for agriculture across the region.</p>
<p>To support the sustainable management of the Congo Basin rainforest, we’ve invested over $600 million in the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment, which brings together the U.S. Government and African and U.S. NGOs.</p>
<p>And we’re building new coalitions between African governments, the private sector, civil society to protect other vital ecosystems across the continent.</p>
<p>Oceans are also a key part of this fight.  That’s why we’ve launched the Ocean Conservation Pledge to encourage countries to commit to protect at least 30 percent of their ocean waters by the year 2030.</p>
