					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to disrupting al-Qa’ida affiliates who exploit under-governed spaces and conflict zones in Syria.  Groups like Hurras al-Din (HaD) are responsible for killings, kidnappings, and violence targeting of members of religious minority groups.</p>
<p>Today, the Department of State is designating Sami Mahmud Mohammed al Uraydi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist for his leadership role in HaD.</p>
<p>The Department’s Rewards for Justice is also offering a reward of up to $5 million for information on the identification or location of al-Uraydi.</p>
<p>As a result of this action, all property and interests in property of al-Uraydi that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and all U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with him.  Any U.S. or foreign persons that engage in certain transactions with this individual may be exposed to sanctions risk, including under secondary sanctions authorities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking is traveling to the Gulf on April 11 to support ongoing efforts to secure a new agreement on a comprehensive peace process.</p>
<p>After over a year of intensive U.S. and UN diplomatic efforts and support from regional partners like Saudi Arabia and Oman, Yemen is witnessing an unprecedented opportunity for peace. The UN-mediated truce, which began in April 2022, laid the foundation for renewed peace efforts while delivering tangible benefits to the Yemeni people. Moving forward, only the Yemeni parties can bring lasting peace and shape a brighter future for their country, which is why a Yemeni-Yemeni political process is urgently needed.</p>
<p>During his visit, Special Envoy Lenderking will meet with Yemeni, Saudi, and international partners to discuss the necessary steps to secure a durable ceasefire and inclusive, UN-mediated political process, while ensuring continued efforts to ease the economic crisis and suffering of Yemenis.</p>

<p>The United States strongly condemns today’s terrorist attacks in the West Bank and Tel Aviv. We extend our deepest condolences to the victims’ families and loved ones, and wish a full recovery to the injured.  The three horrific attacks today, in which three were killed and at least eight others wounded, affected citizens of Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom.  The targeting of innocent civilians of any nationality is unconscionable.  The United States stands with the government and people of Israel.  We are in close contact with our Israeli partners and reaffirm our enduring commitment to their security.</p>

		<title>U.S. Welcomes Canada’s Repatriation from Northeast Syria</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedant Patel, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States appreciates Canada’s repatriation today of 14 women and children from displaced persons camps in northeast Syria.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to our local partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, for their leadership in addressing this complicated situation.  The United States supported Canada’s repatriation today and stands ready to assist other nations in their repatriation efforts.</p>
<p>Resolving the humanitarian and security challenges that followed the dismantlement of ISIS’s so-called “caliphate” is a key priority for the United States and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Daesh.  Approximately 10,000 individuals from more than 60 countries outside Syria and Iraq remain in the al-Hol and Roj displaced persons camps in northeast Syria.  Repatriation is the only durable solution for this population, most of whom are vulnerable children under the age of 12.  Separately, 10,000 ISIS fighters are being held in detention facilities across the region.  This constitutes the single largest concentration of detained terrorist fighters in the world and remains a threat to regional and international security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedant Patel, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today marks one year since the UN-meditated truce in Yemen began and initiated the longest period of calm since the war started. For one year, Yemenis have benefitted from a halt to airstrikes, regular civilian flights from Sana’a airport, enhanced and unrestricted humanitarian and food assistance, and the increased flow of fuel to northern Yemen. The UN-led truce and U.S.-facilitated diplomacy have largely stopped the fighting, saving thousands of civilian lives; nevertheless, the United States recognizes that the truce was only the first step toward a comprehensive, Yemeni-Yemeni political process and a durable resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The truce has paved the way for intensive dialogue on a more comprehensive agreement, and the recent deal to release almost 900 detainees from all sides of the Yemen conflict represents another important step forward. The United States welcomes the efforts of regional partners, including Saudi Arabia and Oman, to advance peace efforts. We remain seriously concerned, however, about Houthi actions that threaten this extraordinary progress and exacerbate the suffering of Yemenis, such as recent attacks in Taiz and Marib and on Yemen’s oil exports. We call on the Houthis to foreswear such actions and pursue a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The truce has also improved the delivery of humanitarian and economic assistance. The United States remains the largest donor and has pledged $444 million so far in 2023. We welcome support from partners, including Saudi Arabia’s recent $1 billion deposit for the Central Bank of Yemen. More assistance is needed for the Yemeni people, and we urgently call on donors to build on the progress on the ground and close the assistance funding gap.</p>
<p>As we continue to support diplomacy to de-escalate tensions wherever possible in the Middle East, the United States is also focused intensively on defending our partners, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, from Iranian-enabled attacks.</p>
<p>Yemen – today – has an unprecedented opportunity for peace. We urge the parties to seize this opportunity to create a brighter future for Yemenis.</p>

		<title>Judgment in Certain Iranian Assets Case</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedant Patel, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today the International Court of Justice issued a judgment in the <i>Certain Iranian Assets</i> case rejecting the vast majority of Iran’s case under the now-terminated Treaty of Amity.  This is a major victory for the United States and victims of Iran’s State-sponsored terrorism.</p>
<p>Iran sought to use the Treaty to challenge payments to U.S. victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism who obtained U.S. court judgments against Iran.  The decision today is a significant blow to Iran’s attempt to avoid its responsibility, in particular to the families of U.S. peacekeepers who were killed in the 1983 bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut.</p>
<p>The United States recognizes the Court’s important role and contributions to the rule of law.  And the United States commends the Court’s ruling related to Bank Markazi.  We are disappointed that the Court has concluded that the turnover of assets of other Iranian agencies and instrumentalities to U.S. victims of Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism was inconsistent with the Treaty.  U.S. courts directed the turnover of assets to victims pursuant to U.S. laws that have helped those and other victims of State-sponsored terrorism receive compensation for the grave losses that they and their families have suffered.  As the United States made clear in its arguments to the Court, the Treaty was never intended to shield Iran from having to compensate U.S. victims of its sponsorship of terrorism.</p>
<p>The Court’s decision was clear that it will have no impact on the U.S. laws that allow U.S. victims of terrorism to seek compensation from Iran or any other State sponsor of terrorism in U.S. courts going forward, in light of the Treaty’s termination.</p>
<p>The United States continues to strongly support victims of terrorism, and we stand with those who seek to hold Iran and all State sponsors of terrorism accountable.</p>
