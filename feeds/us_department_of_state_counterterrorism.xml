					<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedant Patel, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States appreciates Canada’s repatriation today of 14 women and children from displaced persons camps in northeast Syria.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to our local partners, the Syrian Democratic Forces, for their leadership in addressing this complicated situation.  The United States supported Canada’s repatriation today and stands ready to assist other nations in their repatriation efforts.</p>
<p>Resolving the humanitarian and security challenges that followed the dismantlement of ISIS’s so-called “caliphate” is a key priority for the United States and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Daesh.  Approximately 10,000 individuals from more than 60 countries outside Syria and Iraq remain in the al-Hol and Roj displaced persons camps in northeast Syria.  Repatriation is the only durable solution for this population, most of whom are vulnerable children under the age of 12.  Separately, 10,000 ISIS fighters are being held in detention facilities across the region.  This constitutes the single largest concentration of detained terrorist fighters in the world and remains a threat to regional and international security.</p>

		<title>Rewards for Justice – Reward Offer for Information on Ali Mohamed Rage</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the identification or location of al-Shabaab key leader Ali Mohamed Rage.</p>
<p><strong>Ali Mohamed Rage</strong></p>
<p>Ali Mohamed Rage, also known as Ali Dheere, has been al-Shabaab’s chief spokesperson since May 2009 and is a senior leader of the terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Rage was born in the Hawlwadag district of Mogadishu, Somalia in 1966 and has been involved in the planning of attacks in Kenya and Somalia.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2021, the Department of State designated Rage as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). That designation, among other consequences, blocks all property and interests in property belonging to Rage and may expose persons who engage in certain transactions with Rage to designation.  Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction or provides significant financial services for Rage could be subject to U.S. correspondent account or payable-through account sanctions.</p>
<p>On February 18, 2022, the UN Security Council’s Somalia Sanctions Committee added Rage to its Sanctions List pursuant to paragraph 43(a) of resolution 2093 (2013) for engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the peace, security or stability of Somalia.  The UN designation requires UN Member States to impose an arms embargo, including related training and financial assistance, a travel ban, and an assets freeze on Rage.</p>
<p><strong>Al-Shabaab</strong></p>
<p>Al-Shabaab is responsible for terrorist attacks in Kenya, Somalia, and neighboring countries that resulted in loss of life, including of U.S. citizens. The terrorist group continues to plot, plan, and conspire to commit terrorist acts against the United States, U.S. interests, and foreign partners.</p>
<p>The Department of State designated al-Shabaab as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist in March 2008.  In April 2010, al-Shabaab was also added to the 1844 Sanctions List by the UN Security Council’s Somalia Sanctions Committee pursuant to paragraph 8 of resolution 1844 (2008).</p>

All information will be kept strictly confidential.  Relocation for individuals submitting information that leads to the identification or location of Rage may be possible.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $250 million to more than 125 people across the globe who provided actionable information that had helped resolve threats to U.S. national security.

<p>The United States condemns in the strongest terms the horrific terrorist attack that occurred today outside of a synagogue in Jerusalem.  We mourn those killed in the attack, and our thoughts are with the injured, including children.  The notion of people being targeted as they leave a house of worship is abhorrent.  It is particularly tragic that this attack occurred on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States, I express our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and wish those injured a full recovery.  We are in close contact with our Israeli partners and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Israel’s security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of Mohamoud Abdi Aden and any other individual who committed, attempted or conspired to commit, or aided or abetted in the commission of the 2019 attack on the DusitD2 hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 15, 2019, gunmen with the al-Shabaab terrorist group, armed with explosives, automatic weapons, and grenades, attacked the DusitD2 commercial center, a 6-building complex of shops, offices, and a hotel. At least 21 people, including one U.S. citizen, were killed in the assault.</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab, an affiliate of the al-Qa’ida terrorist organization, released live updates throughout the attack and issued a press release in which it stated that the attack was in response to guidance from now deceased al-Qa’ida leader Ayman Zawahiri.</p>
<p>Mohamoud Abdi Aden, aka Mohamud Abdirahman, an al-Shabaab leader, was part of the cell that planned the Dusit2 Hotel attack. In October 2022, the Department of State designated Aden as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended.</p>
<p>Al-Shabaab is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Kenya, Somalia, and neighboring countries that have killed thousands of people, including U.S. citizens. The terrorist group continues to plot, plan, and conspire to commit terrorist acts against the United States, U.S. interests, and foreign partners.</p>
<p>The Department of State designated al-Shabaab as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in March 2008. In April 2010, al-Shabaab was also designated by the UN Security Council’s Somalia Sanctions Committee pursuant to paragraph 8 of resolution 1844 (2008).</p>

Sham Express, set up to illegally transfer money on behalf of ISIS financial facilitators between Türkiye, Syria, and Iraq, is being designated for having materially assisted ISIS.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of Maalim Ayman or any individual who committed, attempted, or conspired to commit, or aided or abetted in the commission of the January 5, 2020 terrorist attack on U.S. and Kenyan personnel at the Manda Bay Airfield in Kenya.</p>
<p>Maalim Ayman is the leader of Jaysh Ayman, an al-Shabaab unit conducting terrorist attacks and operations in Kenya and Somalia.  Ayman was responsible for preparing the January 2020 attack.  In November 2020, the Department of State designated Ayman as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended.</p>
<p>In the pre-dawn attack, al-Shabaab terrorists killed a U.S. soldier and two U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors and wounded two other U.S. service members and a third DoD contractor.  In a video subsequently released by al-Shabaab, a spokesperson for the group claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>The Manda Bay Airfield is part of a Kenyan Defence Forces military base utilized by U.S. armed forces to provide training and counterterrorism support to East African partners, respond to crises, and protect U.S. interests in the region.</p>
<p>Based in East Africa, al-Shabaab is one of al-Qaida’s most dangerous affiliates and is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Kenya, Somalia, and neighboring countries that have killed thousands of people, including U.S. citizens.  The terrorist group continues to plot, plan, and conspire to commit terrorist acts against the United States, U.S. interests, and foreign partners.</p>
