<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I offer congratulations to President Sall and the people of Senegal as you celebrate 63 years of independence.</p>
<p>On this national day, we reaffirm the close bonds between Senegal and the United States. Our partnership is one rooted in the shared ideals of democracy, security, and economic prosperity, and we greatly value Senegal’s leadership and commitment to ensuring regional stability through its substantial contributions to peacekeeping operations around the globe. My conversations with President Sall at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit on the full range of pressing issues – food and health security, climate, elevating African voices in matters of global governance, and pushing back against democratic backsliding in Africa – underscore the depth and breadth of the U.S.-Senegal friendship. We look forward to deepening our partnership in these areas in the coming months.</p>
<p>I extend to all Senegalese my best wishes for health and prosperity in the year ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Vedant Patel, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is increasingly concerned by the continuing violence in Lascanood and joins other international partners and neighbors in calling for de-escalation, adherence to the agreed ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, and resumption of constructive dialogue towards peaceful resolution. Continued violence will increase the potential for extremist groups to sow broader instability and further exacerbate the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>We call on Somaliland to pull back its security forces as a demonstration of its commitment to these principles. We call on the militias in Lascanood to refrain from any offensive actions against Somaliland forces. We support the Federal Government of Somalia’s constructive engagement and deployment of a clan elders’ delegation and welcome Somaliland President Bihi’s commitment to meet with the delegation in Hargeisa.</p>
<p>We also note with concern that Somaliland’s presidential elections have been delayed since November 2022, well beyond the timing set forth in Somaliland’s constitution. We call on the Somaliland authorities to set a clear timeline and complete the elections as soon as possible. The United States stands ready to use authorities under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the issuance of visas to current or former Somali officials or other individuals who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the democratic process in Somalia, including in Somaliland.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>The following is being released jointly by the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</em></p>
<p><em>Begin Text.</em></p>
<p>On Friday President Biden announced 10-year plans for implementing the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability in partnership with Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and Coastal West Africa, including Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo.  These plans represent a commitment to global peace and security, with the United States working alongside an array of local partners toward shared, long-term goals of conflict prevention and peacebuilding.</p>
<p>The Strategy and these plans draw on lessons learned and identify innovative approaches to support locally driven solutions, strengthen resilience, and forge a more peaceful and democratic future.  The Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Defense are working together to facilitate greater coordination and collaboration at all levels and leveraging our respective roles to advance diplomatic, development, security, and programmatic efforts.  The Department of State and USAID are designing flexible, adaptive programs that empower our local government, civil society, and civilian security partners.  The Department of Defense is supporting civil-military engagement, training and equipping of partner militaries, defense institutional capacity building, and the professionalization of security forces.  The Department of the Treasury is leading engagements with international financial institutions to coordinate our assistance in line with these plans.</p>
<p>This effort builds on the vision of the bipartisan Global Fragility Act and ongoing engagement with Congressional leaders and key stakeholders ranging from local civil society, community leaders, academics, and the private sector.  Through intensive coordination, continual assessment, and monitoring and evaluation, together we will use these 10-year plans to address drivers of conflict and violence collectively and to support our partner countries in pursuing peace and prosperity.</p>
